Awesome dining experience. Will definitely go back,5,5,5,5,today
Great food. wonderful selection. amazing desserts. outstanding service. can’t wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,2 days ago
Food was fantastic! Waitress was not great. Also to beg to get drinks. Refills were even harder to get. even just water.,3,5,2,4,2 days ago
Way overpriced!! We got a tiny table that you could barely fit 2 plates on.,1,1,1,1,2 days ago
Checked into reservation and sat in line for 40 minutes before leaving.,2,2,1,4,2 days ago
For the value of the money. not worth it. Food quality has gone downhill. Cold food being served.What's the rude workers,2,3,2,2,2 days ago
Service was fantastic. and Mark took great care of us.  Food choices were broad and most were okay. The crab was mostly over-cooked. which made the meat difficult to separate from the shell.  While still the best buffet in Vegas. the cost has continued to rise to the point where only the biggest eaters will get their money’s worth.,3,3,5,4,2 days ago
Very expensive. Lots of selection. Slow and inattentive service. Will not return.,3,4,2,3,3 days ago
Food quality great. food selection ok but way too overpriced for the variety of food. We paid over 100 dollars per person and really. not worth the price. Also. they time you when you get there and you literally have 90 minutes to sit down. eat and go. Sorry. but not worth the price,3,4,4,4,3 days ago
It was our first time there. Organized seating for customers. Too much food! I love the octopus. My sister loves the ceviches. The cajun seafood was a bit spicy for me but it was still good. The asian barbecue was really good. We were happy to see lechon on the buffet.,5,5,5,5,3 days ago
Excellent food. Worth the price. Great variety of different types of food.,5,5,5,5,3 days ago
Average taste. Big range of food. The deserts must be little more than this. Cheesecake Factory has way better desert. Cream brûlée was fantastic. Prime rib was gorgeous but they don’t add salt. It will be great if they had maldon. 8/10,4,4,5,4,3 days ago
Imperdible. para mi el mejor Buffet de Vegas!!!! El precio de 95 Dls se desquita perfectamente con el área de mariscos. si no comes mariscos no creo que desquites el costo.,5,5,4,4,3 days ago
Good food and great variety but extremely overpriced. One and done restaurant.,4,4,2,2,3 days ago
It was our first time to dine at Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar’s to celebrate my son’s birthday. At check in the lady checking us in for our times reservations start lecturing me that I should have included our two babies in our reservations  and she makes feel unwelcomed until one of the lady interfere because she noticed I was getting frustrated with her and start taking over and helped us. I just felt it’s not a very good hospitality service.  But the service inside and the food was very satisfactory overall.,4,4,5,4,3 days ago
Been coming here for years.  Usually it’s great experience but this last rodeo left me saying it’s just OK.  We usually go for the crawfish but this time it just wasn’t good. no attention to these anymore seems like.  But the thing that really disappointed me was the cold Mexican pozole soup.  It was so cold I almost spit it out.  Don’t get me wrong this buffet is still great and I we’ll be back in the future.  Hopefully it was just a bad day.  Desert never disappoints.,3,3,2,3,4 days ago
The food quality. wasn’t. has good has other times we been there the food was cold and the quality has gone down. I had to ask for my steam crap legs because they were cold. The brisket wasn’t has tender. The pice has gone up and quality down. I was looking forward to bone marrow and there wasn’t any to my disappointment. I believe the food should be good early in the day. just like the evening because we still paid $180 dollars.,2,2,4,3,4 days ago
Food and service when were seated was excellent. I don’t understand why we had to wait another 10-15 min to get ushered to our table even with a reservation. I understand the maybe 5 min wait. but beyond that is ridiculous. The price for alcoholic beverage is outrageous. So will we go back? Maybe - for the food.,4,4,4,4,4 days ago
I made a reservation and am a Diamond member. They made me go to a diamond line instead of the reservation line and that ended up making me wait 45 minutes instead of being seated. There is no diamond discount and I could care less anorak the rewards from $200. They were so rude when I asked why I can’t just self pay and acted like it was impossible. Then all of the 7 star members kept getting pulled and the regular line kept getting pulled and they would take one diamond like everything 7-8 parties. The food was good but I’m sure I can find comparable food at this price point where I would be treated better. 0/10 would not recommend. Camilla the hostess was awful.,1,4,1,2,4 days ago
I thought for the price.  o do t know if 90 minutes  was enough time to truly enjoy everything. Maybe you should consider changing it to 2 hours instead. Just my 2 cents.  Thank you.,5,5,5,5,4 days ago
Thanks for a great experience.  Food was outstanding.,5,5,5,5,4 days ago
Food taste was not worth the price. I would not go back,1,1,2,2,5 days ago
I read so many reviews that said Bacchanal was THE place to go.  It is absolutely not.  The food was incredibly hit or miss. and the misses far outweighed the hits.  The lumpia. pork skewers. and desserts were great.  The dumplings. hot crab. cold seafood. brisket. and just about everything else we tried was fine - but not worth $100 a person.  I couldn’t eat enough to make it worth that cost. and honestly. I didn’t want to.  The service was great.  If this place is comped or if you get a discount. totally worth it.  In any other situation. avoid at all costs.  This place is highway robbery.  We were wholly bamboozled.  Don’t make the same mistake.,2,1,3,2,5 days ago
It used to be great buffet. quality of food are down. Some dishes weren’t edible at all. The dessert section is still wonderful.,3,3,2,2,5 days ago
Recommended by a frequent visitor to LV. Now I recommend it to all coming in. It was 185.00 for 2 people. Don’t get sticker shock. it was well worth it. Planned accordingly though. lite snack for breakfast then hit it at 1-2. Hope y’all have a great experience like we did. 10/10. will return.,5,5,5,5,5 days ago
The food was not hot. Service: understaffed. Good server. but very little they could do to make up for the expensive cool to room temperature food.,1,2,2,2,5 days ago
Plenty of vegetarian options and even a small vegan station with 3-4 entrees. Same with the desserts - a whole section of vegan treats and dairy free gelato options. Not many fish options if you’re a pescatarian. it was mainly seafood. TONS of shellfish but I’m allergic so I had to skip that. I found a seared salmon option in the Italian section. tuna rolls at the Asian station. and an interesting looking fish soup in the Mexican section.,5,5,5,5,5 days ago
Made a reservation but wasn’t really busy on a Thursday morning. A wide selection of food of several nationalities and a wonderful omelette station.,5,5,5,4,6 days ago
Je viens de rentrer à Paris et le sentiment reste le même. le buffet était incroyable. j'ai particulièrement apprécié les viandes et les sushis. c'était vraiment très bon. L'autre point très positif était qu'il n'y avait aucune odeur de nourriture dans tout l'environnement !!!,5,5,5,5,6 days ago
For the price. $800 for 9 people. was expecting more than 90 mins of dinner with my family. I think its too much for its price. The ambiance is too basic and we didn't get as much service as we need. We have to catch a server to get coffee.,3,4,5,3,7 days ago
Excellent. as always! The selection is impressive and there truly is something for everyone.,5,5,5,5,7 days ago
Good wasn’t that god based on the cost.  We won’t come back and definitely tell others not to throw away their money.,1,2,5,3,7 days ago
I had the endcap of the primerib.  It was bland and just ok.  The brisket was good.  The shrimp was good.  Mussels were still partially frozen.  The lobster claws tasted off and I only ate one because I didn't trust them.  The meat on a stick was pretty good.  Other people at the table felt the same way with their seafood.  They tried it and said it tasted off.    The desserts were great though.,3,2,4,3,7 days ago
By far the worse buffet we've been. save your hard- earned money and go to regular fast-food restaurants outside the hotel. I was looking forward to eating crab legs but greatly disappointed. they're so salty to a point it's not even edible. The rest of the food selections were either bland. greasy or completely off the expected taste. Look like reheated/ recycle food from previous days. You can't even get comfortable. the chairs are horrendous. the seats have zero support. so your bottom sink deep & you're getting force to sit at the edge ( solid metal ). They give you 90 min. limit to finish eating. we're so disgusted. in less than 30 min. we're up & started walking out.,1,1,2,2,December 3 2024
Awesome dessert selections. For the crab and meat lovers. Id skip the Chinese and Mexican selections. Save the tummy for seafood and dessert.,5,5,3,4,December 3 2024
A lot of average preparation choices of food. Dessert station the best. Meat good selection. Seafood average and the lobster claws over-cooked and dried out. Nothing sit-down dinner quality but bulk wise very good.,3,4,3,3,December 3 2024
what can you not like … it’s Bacchanel at its best fresh creative foods / live stations,5,5,5,5,December 2 2024
For the amount of money paid. the food was not up to par. It did not incorporate every cultural desire on its buffet and the fact that it includes all you can eat snow crab that looks picked over is not enough to justify a $178.00 for 2. There was no wait to be seated which was excellent and our waitress was wonderful. Otherwise. I will not be visiting Bacchanal ever again!,3,2,5,5,December 2 2024
I’ve read many things saying it’s hyped up and not worth it. I wish I had listened to that advice. When paying this for a buffet you’d expect to see better options. have all hot food be hot and cold food be cold and have your plates cleared during the meal. That was not the case. I’d also expect to see some high end restaurant dishes. not just variety.,3,3,3,3,December 2 2024
Food variety. Tasty food. Service staff are mixed bag.  crowded and no so friendly staff.  Our waiter was good though.,4,4,3,3,December 2 2024
If your into seafood. this place is calling your name. Great service. great options. very clean,5,5,5,5,December 2 2024
Totally overrated! Def no second time. Don’t bother going,1,1,2,1,December 2 2024
I loved the experience…the presentation of the food. the taste. and the friendly employees. The process to be seated could use some efficiencies. We arrived at our reservation time and others were seated before us. The roasted meats looked delectable but the prime rib tasted like pot roast because it was cooked too long. The same with the brisket - dry. The seafood was really good as was the Asian noodles. Overall my girlfriend and I loved the experience And recommend others to try.,4,4,5,4,December 2 2024
The verity of food was excellent. The prime rib was very tasty. Deserts had a good verity and was very tasty. The only downfall was that the lobster claws and crab legs were served cold. The warm crab legs were offered slowly. In my taste. the lobster and crab legs should be served warm. Shrimp are ok.  served cold.. Price was a little high. However. everything along the strip is highly priced. Overall. good choices and good food.,4,3,4,5,December 1 2024
A must-try buffet. Each cuisine is an assorte of carefully chef-ed delicacies. cooked to near perfection (as far as a buffet can reasonably stretch). served right (temperature. curation and counter map). by a friendly staff. The 90-min stay may be a tad tight for a few. but is kinda ok for moderate mealers like me. Overall a worthy visit at every Vegas trip.,5,5,5,4,December 1 2024
We had a fantastic brunch and the food and service was amazing!,5,5,5,5,December 1 2024
The crab was really good. mashed potatoes were excellent. however. prime rib was super fatty. the desserts were not great at all. The crepe was okay. but crème brulee was too custardy. wasn’t enough crisp on top. there were a couple of things just overly sweet. The sugar free blueberry dessert was the best. The gelato was meh. The server was pretty attentive to clearing plates and refilling drinks tho.  Overall $85/person for that was not worth it! I can see why a ton of casinos are going away from buffets. Bachannal used to be super good. idk what happened.,3,3,4,4,December 1 2024
Must-visit in Vegas! We come every time we are in Vegas! Bacchanal Buffet offers an unbeatable variety of delicious food. especially their incredible crab legs and desserts. The lines can be long. but it’s totally worth it reserve a few days in advance for the best experience!,5,5,4,5,December 1 2024
Bad food quality. not too much variety. Deserts was ok.,2,2,3,3,December 1 2024
Every time I  come to Vegas I put Bacchanal Buffet on my to do list and it never disappoints.  You can choose from a wide variety of meals and they all are delicious.  Truly worth the money and the experience.,5,5,3,4,December 1 2024
"The crab legs. lobster claws. and scallops were very dry. The cold shrimp with shells were mushy. and the steamed shrimp dumpling shells were hard and dry. After tips. the total came to almost $120 on Thanksgiving weekend. Even with a reservation. we still had to wait 35 minutes. The food was so bad that even if someone offered to pay for my bill. I wouldn’t go back.""",1,1,1,1,December 1 2024
I made a reservation for 5:45 PM but got seats at 6:35 PM.,4,5,3,5,December 1 2024
We had a scheduled reservation for 545 for 4 people.   We arrived on time to find a very long line and poor signage to indicate which line we were to join.  After 5 minutes in the incorrect line. we were redirected to the correct line. which was to confirm our reservation.   While reservation confirmation was timely. it took 45 minutes to get to the cashier to pay.  By this point. we had spoken to the manager about the profound delays several times without proper resolution.  Our kids were starting to feel tired and faint from standing in the line while waiting to eat with an as yet undetermined time when they would be able to get in. so we again asked for some kind of resolution.  At which point. we were taken to another line to wait.  This line took ~20 minutes to stand in prior to being shown to our table.  If we had remained in the existing line. it would have been at least another 45 minutes to get to eat.  In addition. one patron had their dog in a carriage and was planning on entering the restaurant with said dog.  The dog was small and could not have been a service animal.  We are allergic to dog dander. so were dismayed to see the unsanitary nature of having an animal who is not a service animal come into the restaurant.   The food was ok for the most part. but with somewhat less variety than at the Wynn buffet. In addition. some of the stations did not appear to be open (the made to order taco station. for example. was not running).  Overall. we would not go to this buffet again.,2,3,1,2,December 1 2024
Lots of delicious food selections. Pricey. but reasonable for the food offered. The service was outstanding. Still a 30 min wait with reservations for a party of 6. I enjoyed my dinner here with family.,4,5,5,4,December 1 2024
Make a reservation to wait in line for a party of 5 to be seated at a 4 top table.  Takes an hour to get drinks. have to search out water refills.  Mediocre food at best. which is obtained by waiting in more lines.  The only good thing is that some foods list some allergens on their hard to read signs.,2,2,1,1,December 1 2024
The food is nothing special. just very ordinary stuff. similar to any buffet restaurant. but the price is several times more expensive. not worth the price.,2,3,3,3,December 1 2024
All food was wonderful. just a little bit expensive,5,5,5,4,November 30 2024
I was really excited to visit Bacchanal Buffet for the first time. but my first impressions weren't great. There were no welcoming smiles from the staff. who seemed more focused on getting people to pay. get seated. and leave quickly. For $100 per person at Caesar's. I expected better.  I knew they offered lobster. but it was just claws—and they were tough! The staff mentioned they haven't served full lobsters for a few years. which was a major disappointment. Every time I needed something. it was difficult to find my table server. When I did. they bused my table while I was still there. I found out they don't have dedicated busers; the servers do both. which felt unhygienic as they touched dirty plates and then handled my napkins. cutlery. and glasses. No. thank you!  The buffet looked incredible. but the high volume seemed to affect food quality. For example. the Chinese Emperor's Chicken had sauce carelessly scattered on it. and the shrimp slider buns were hard from sitting too long under the heaters. Meanwhile. I noticed VIPs received frequent service. smiles. and special dishes. Honestly. I’ve had better service at low-end casino buffets for half the price with comparable food.  I'm disappointed in Caesar's and its leadership. though the variety of choices was impressive. Overall. the experience felt like a debauchery with so much food and people swarming around their plates.,2,3,2,2,November 30 2024
For $95 plus tax dinner on a Saturday during Thanksgiving weekend. I expected something more special. All they served was the same old food items. nothing special. The King Crab legs are overcooked. Steamed Shrimps were mushy. the pita bread on Gyro was undercooked (tasted like dough). the Tonkutso Ramen was salty. the Sushi were falling apart. I only enjoyed the mussels. cocktail shrimp. Shumai and some of the Mexican food that I don’t normally eat on a regular day buffet there. Totally disappointed. Not to mention. we made reservation and their priority are group of 4 regardless of where you’re at in the waiting line. There’s 4 couples ahead of us and waited longer to be seated than those group of 3-4 bypassing who’s in line. Our server Marvin is the only 1 who deserves 5 star ⭐️,3,2,5,4,November 30 2024
Bacchanal is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas!  I was excited to experience the epicurean delights of the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar’s!  It’s definitely an experience for anyone visiting Vegas.,5,5,5,5,November 30 2024
The service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive. cleared the dishes and refused coffee and drinks frequently. But 3 members of my party got sick right after eating the buffet. I was the only one not ill. Certain it was the food!,1,1,5,2,November 30 2024
Excellent food and service.the price is worth and friendly waitress,5,5,5,5,November 30 2024
We went in for the breakfast buffet since it was the only available time slot. Our reservation was for 10:30 on a Saturday. We did not get sat down until 10:50. There was a 15 minute line for the crab legs. It was 11:05 when I got to finally sit down and take my first bite. 55 minutes later 12:00) the manager told us they had a group reserve the table for 12:30 and that our 90 minutes was up.   There were no oysters. no lobster claws or snails and no lamb chops even for a weekend menu. Those are for dinner only but that information was not made available. The food selection for breakfast was very disappointing and not worth the nearly $100 price tag. The sushi selection was comical and comparative to a grocery store pre made sushi menu.   The only saving grace was the waiter and the rest of the staff. They were extremely nice. attentive and professional.   I do not recommend the breakfast menu. Maybe give the dinner menu a try if you are lucky enough to get an opening.,2,2,4,3,November 30 2024
Great staff. great food! Omar served us from behind the bar. welcoming. knowledgeable and professional. Many thanks to everyone at Binions,5,5,5,5,November 30 2024
It was fine but too crowded and too many people. Long lines for food. Not a huge fan of buffet in any case,3,3,3,3,November 30 2024
This has to be the worst buffet ever. The wait was over 2 hours.. and the foods are so bad. It was a waste of money.,1,1,5,1,November 30 2024
We had a wonderful experience dining at the buffet! Food was absolutely delicious! I will recommend to family and friends to eat there 💯% Thank you Caesars ( Warren & Sareeta,5,5,5,5,November 30 2024
Last call is. 10:45 pm in which everything will be taken away so be prepared.,5,5,4,5,November 30 2024
The steak was cold and they put pork next to beef not everyone eats pork and the gentleman was using the same knowledge to cut pork and beef.non pork eaters has less to eat which is less for the amount of money we pay almost $100 per person,1,1,5,5,November 30 2024
Not worth the money waitress had a face like she hated her job,2,2,1,4,November 30 2024
Did not get to actually eat here after making reservations weeks in advance. It is not noted that even once reservations are made you still have to wait in line to checkin and that can take 30-60 minutes. Then upon being seated you have a timed dinning experience. Very disappointed in this process and it is unfortunate that I was not able to partake.,1,1,1,1,November 29 2024
It is definitely buffet. That means some items are good. Some are ok. Good-carving station. The prime rib. brisket. meats in general stand out. Crab legs are just ok. There is a time limit. Still a long line waiting for crab. Better system is needed. Some crackers over steamed making them hard to separate meat from shell and in an accomplished crab meat extractor. Mexican is ho hum with exception of birria which is good. Desserts are ok. Salads are wilted and not great. The seating area pedestrian. It’s a buffet. As those go it’s ok. I stuck mainly with protein. Enjoyed but unlikely to return.,3,3,3,2,November 29 2024
It's worth bringing folks that have not been before. but if you've gone once. it starts losing its luster.  Don't get me wrong. it's a huge selection of quality food. You can really stuff your face. But the older you get. getting stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable really loses its appeal.  I like to tip in cash. and I tip depending on the service.  Unfortunately. this time service was horrible.  It's a buffet. I'm happy if you clear the used plates and ask at least once if we need our drinks refilled. Nope.  We had to flag down random waiters to ask for our waiter since he seemed to spend all of his time in the kitchen.  Even then. he never showed up.  Eventually. we flagged a manager. and he finally came. He was not happy and showed it.  I still left a tip in cash. even though my wife urged me not to. but man. I struggled.  This guy makes good money. and there are hundreds who would kill for this job.  I paid lots of money for my family to have an enjoyable brunch only to have to deal with someone who shouldn't be in service.  Anyway. as I said. great if it's your first time. and hopefully. you get a better server.,4,4,3,4,November 29 2024
Extremely limited vegetarian options. Not a good value for anyone with any dietary restrictions.,3,2,3,3,November 29 2024
Outstanding spread as always!  I went on Black Friday and the place was busy but the staff was very accommodating!  Will go back!,5,5,5,5,November 29 2024
Overrated and overpriced.  Cleanliness is concerning...Dinning tables and floor are dirty. Plenty of selection for food but most are junk. only a handful of options i would consider decent.  Very disappointing experience.  my first visit to this buffet and probably the last as well.,1,2,2,1,November 29 2024
Was sick in the bathroom for 3 days after eating just one plate there (fried shrimp and roasted pig).,2,2,4,2,November 29 2024
We were sat in the room in back so far away from the buffet and the room was very basic. prob because we had a party of 12.  Waitress barely spoke English and did not look as if she wanted to get drink orders.  She must’ve been in a bad mood because she kept rolling her eyes.  Kept telling us to go up to the buffet first.  Table was cramped. pretty sure it was meant for a party of 10.  Food was mediocre.  Had a the lunch buffet the day after thanksgiving and our bill was $1400+ automatic  gratuity on a $100 dollar buffet for 12 people.  It was so underwhelming.  Only thing worthy was prob the snow crabs.  Nothing else was memorable.  Food was not bad.  Just ok.  Overpriced.  We will never go back.,3,3,3,1,November 29 2024
Super delicious and worth the money! Lots of variety for everyone.,5,5,5,5,November 29 2024
Great experience. crazy price!  But you probably lost even more money gambling.  That said -- given the price you charge. how about some live music for diners?   As I see that's an option in the comments section here,5,5,5,5,November 29 2024
I was very disappointed with the service. The food was not great like it used to be. It was very average. I will not be coming to this buffet again. I was so disappointed. I spent $247 to get average service. The turkey dinner was terrible. That’s what I went there for for Thanksgiving.,1,2,1,3,November 29 2024
Something that you should try it once for the experience but I realized is more the hype than anything else. Food was good but not great.,4,4,4,4,November 29 2024
We made a reservation for 6 PM and arrived at 5:45 PM. as recommended. Despite this. we ended up waiting over an hour. While we understand delays. the issue was that several groups who arrived last minute were seated before us. When we brought it up to the hostess. she rudely explained that they were “maximizing capacity.” Essentially. because our group had 5 people instead of 6. we were pushed aside to accommodate larger groups. This made no sense. especially since we had already been charged. Watching three groups of 6 get seated ahead of us was incredibly frustrating. Unfortunately. my last time attending. The that’s not even mentioning the service and food.,1,3,1,1,November 29 2024
Not to remember an experience. maybe food could have been better,3,1,1,2,November 29 2024
Wow. what a meal! Everything I ate was delicious. well prepared and served at the correct temperature. The waiters and waitresses were very amiable and helpful. I have never had such a large variety of food where every genre of food was so well prepared. Great Thanksgiving meal..,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
Upon our arrival we checked in an hour early because of the expected wait. We were given 90 minutes to eat our thanksgiving meal. The food stations were not labeled or arranged in a sensible manner. There were also no restaurant personnel providing traffic control at the stations. This resulted in everyone wasting time waiting to just look at the available options. Plus people were cutting in line with the excuse of “I only want to grab just one of these”.  To make matters worse. people were eating with their hands. licking their fingers. then grabbing the utensils to grab food. If a viral bug starts from this place I wouldn’t be surprised. The Chinese ribs. duck. and beef tasted old and dry. The traditional thanksgiving food items were disappointing. The turkey was dry and unappealing. The pork bruschetta was crunchy and had a peculiar sour taste. The brisket had too much fat making it greasy and salty. The prime rib was good however the two guys serving the brisket and prime rib were rude and simply put “a$$ holes”. The green beans and brussel sprouts were under cooked making them taste bitter. The dessert area was disappointing because it was out of several items. Sad part of this story is that I have eaten here before and I know how good it can be. This is the reason I am very disappointed about how they presented and prepared this Thanksgiving buffet.  I paid over $300 for 3 people. The quality and service Ceasars provided was not only disappointing but embarrassingly third rate.  The atmosphere and vibes from the supervisors working the floor felt chaotic and stressful. They appeared to be overwhelmed by the volume of people inside. I can’t understand why because reservations were needed so they had control of the volume coming in and they should of had the food stations fully stocked and organized. I would not recommend the Thanksgiving buffet here to anyone. I hope we don’t catch anything from the dirty utensils covered in other people’s saliva.,1,1,1,1,November 28 2024
I wouldn’t considered this the best buffet we’ve ever been to. It it large? Sure. but it’s basically quantity over quality here.  For the pricing I would expect service to be top tier and it wasn’t. To star out. the table was not cleaned properly that we were sat at. Underneath the lip of the table was a dark purple custard all along the edge. and when our child slid into the booth it’s got all over his dress shirt.. staining it… we waited about 20mins before a server got to our table to assist with cleaning it and getting some water to get off the substance. After finally getting to go out to the buffets which are full of line(which is fine). we were done with our first plates but didn’t have room for additional plates so we waited for them to get cleared out. Apparently the server we originally had was done for the day and didn’t tell us bye. We had to find server walking by to get plates clean. The new server didn’t want to serve us since we weren’t her original table. How is that our fault we were sat at a shift change? We were maybe on our second plate when the serve said our 90mins was up and we had to leave.. when booking his reservation the time quoted is 2 hours in my email and half of the “90 mins” was spent waiting on servers. When we mentioned not being told the time had been shorted the new server Ramona walked away and just send a manager our way to tell us we needed to leave. He was a shorter bald gentleman. There wasn’t any apologies for the lack of service we had already received and he was extremely rude with no empathy toward the situation. We spent $700 to dine as a family which we were happy to do until we realized this establishment doesn’t care what your are spending and how your experience is. The want your money then want you out.,2,3,1,5,November 28 2024
Absolutly excellent! Highly recommend.  Great food. lots to choose from. Very organized with fresh. hot food.,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
The food was good but not worth the price! We likely won’t return unless the price is lowered significantly. It’s not that good!,3,3,5,3,November 28 2024
It was Thanksgiving. very busy but food was very good!,4,5,3,4,November 28 2024
It was Thanksgiving day so it was very crowded and loud.,4,4,3,4,November 28 2024
Decent food and maybe a good value during a normal visit. We visited for Thanksgiving and even with reservations. the lines were very long and not worth getting into a separate lines for seconds. I would not visit again during a holiday but would come back during a different time.,4,4,4,5,November 28 2024
With reservations the wait was over an hour. The lines were ridiculously long and spent more time try to get food than actually eating. The food wasn’t worth the exorbitant cost and the Maître d’ was very rude when I asked about the payment process. Over all it was supposed to be special for my kids birthdays and as a single mom I saved to give them this and it wasn’t worth it at all. Dessert was wonderful I will say.,1,1,1,1,November 28 2024
This buffe is not worth it. They did not prominently post the price for Thanksgiving. When I made my reservation. the price was noted as 80.00/pp but it was actually 97.00/pp. I did not see that posted anywhere. The high cost is for the seafood. so if you don't eat seafood. it's not worth it. Also. there were no whole turkeys being carved for Thanksgiving. they had other meats being carved but the turkey was already cut up in a pan. There was no special Thanksgiving set up... it looked like a normal buffet and the turkey was an afterthought. The worst part was that there was one person at the carving station for ham. sausages etc... the carver seemed miserable. no smiles. not happy to serve. There was a long line for the carving station and the carver kept stopping the line while he went to the back to get more sausages and organizing them on the line...telling people to just wait in a negative tone (why wasn't there a backup person to assist with this?); very poor management of the process. Also. there was 90-minute time limit (understandable) but 15 minutes before our time was up. our waitress was already telling us about the 90-minute time limit...very unprofessional. I would never eat here again. For the price... the service. quality and coordination are well below expectation.,2,3,2,3,November 28 2024
I’ve been to Bacchanal Buffet many times in past years and it was always amazing. Thanksgiving brunch was disappointing. The turkey was delicious and everything else was meh.  I’m not sure if I’ll be returning.,3,1,4,4,November 28 2024
Our experience did not meet my expectations for a Thanksgiving dinner. It was no better than a cruise ship buffet. The food was good but not exceptional. The experience was way overpriced for what we got. Guests were rude and cut in line. And we felt under pressure the entire time to eat quickly and not relax. We will not be returning. Later that day I was walking past Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse at another Caesar’s property and noticed their Thanksgiving fixed price menu. We could have had a quiet and relaxing experience at a well known steakhouse for what we paid for the buffet. My fault for not doing better research.,2,3,3,2,November 28 2024
The one thing they don’t mention is that even if you have a reservation you may still need to wait in a line to be seated after paying! We did come on thanksgiving but would have liked to know this before hand.,4,4,4,4,November 28 2024
Food is awesome. service was professional. check in was quick.  We had reservations so it was quick.  I just noticed something. maybe my imagination. but seems like all the Asian people are all placed in one area.  Other than that. everything g is outstanding .,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
Wait staff was great and attentive. I arrived at opening which was disorganized. We entered prior to 9am. My waitress said to help myself to the buffet. The head server cane over to me and said to wait until 8:45am. Everyone returned to their seats. Then as new customers entered they went to the buffet and were served. Those of us who were still seated then went ahead to the buffet. The meat servers were unsmiling and looked unhappy. The experience was otherwise great.,4,5,4,5,November 28 2024
open a reservation at 500 for 530. table of 4. Never got a text until after midnight. Obs too long to wait. Terrible system. No staff could tell me how long the wait was. And since they are packed. they obs don't care. Too bad. looked awesome form a distance.,1,1,1,1,November 28 2024
Food was great.  There was something for every diet types. The 90 Minutes time limit is more than enough.,5,5,5,4,November 28 2024
It was prethanksgiving dinner for us and the price is quite high for the similar food we had when we visited the restaurant before. But quality in the food was excellent.,4,5,5,5,November 28 2024
lots of choices some of the craved meat was cold and dry. but I tossed it and wet back and it was fine. Its s till a good value with all the choices. It is still the best full service buffet on the strip,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
We were supposed to have 90 minutes due to reservation restrictions. they tried to put us out after 35 minutes and we had to literally prove that we had only been seated for 35 minutes. it was very rude and uncomfortable. We were monitored the rest of the night after that,2,3,1,2,November 28 2024
Bachhanal Buffet is like what was expected based on our research. and more. As lovers of all things crustacean. we definitely enjoyed the plentiful crab legs. lobster claws. prawns. Dungeness crab and shrimp. What was a pleasant surprise was how they have so much more. and everything was really good. We indulged in salmon. prime rib. duck. as well as tasty grilled vegetables and Boursin mashed potatoes. Desserts were equally delicious with just about anything you could imagine. Smart serving sizes helped keep you from really overdoing it. Overall it was a lovely experience. and one I would recommend to others.,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
This was our first time dining here.  The buffet offered many stations with a variety of food from seafood. meat carvings. asian. Mexican. etc. with amazing desserts.  The restaurant was packed with too many people.  There was a long line to get snow crab legs where we spent waiting close to ~15 minutes.  It would have been more efficient to already dish out crab legs onto a plate (similar to how other Vegas buffets) to reduce long line. especially since there’s a 90-minutes time limit & people were picking & choosing crab legs.  We weren’t as impressed. mainly due to overcrowded setting.,4,4,4,3,November 28 2024
Some of the dishes I wanted to try and that were shown on the website or on the video screens and on YouTube were not present. There was limited gluten free options . for example nothing in the Asian or sushi section except one sashimi (which kept running out) and one vegetarian sushi rice. nothing in the Italian or bread section. only 4 of the dozens of desserts (excluding gelato). even the macarons had gluten! The grilled salmon was topped with battered and fried strings of what were probably onions even though the large LED display at the check in line showed it topped with lovely enoki mushrooms. The seafood was nearly all gluten free of course. but the cold lobster claws were flavorless and the crab was overcooked. Scallops were good but there was only 1 per plate and they kept running out. Overall Not a good value for me.,2,3,2,2,November 28 2024
Don’t waste your money.  The quality of the foods is not good at all.,1,1,1,1,November 28 2024
Two of us Dined at this Buffet Restaurant paying $85/person plus taxes. I do not think the food is worth the price. I have seen everyone lining up to crab legs. If you do not like crab legs. then it is waste of money and time. On top of that they time your table (90min) which is crazy. I know it is plenty but I did not like the time limit you spend together at Dinner table.,2,2,3,1,November 28 2024
WARNING ALL TO READ THIS BEFORE BOOKING. Made reservation months before we went on 11-27-2024. day before Thanksgiving.  When you reserve online. instructions say if you cancel less than 2 days of the reservation. you will be charged $25 per person.  Need credit card to make reservation. We thought NBD.  Our reservation is 2 adults & 3 kids.  On the 26th. the day before our reservation. we get an email from Patricia Rojas. ASST MANAGER stating they've increase their prices due to the holidays.  When we booked. I think it was $69.99. Patricia said that the holiday price will be $94.99. a $25 increase.  I respond to Patricia's email that it's the day before Thanksgiving & that's not a holiday as well as the notification is within the 2 day penalty window to cancel. feels like this is restaurant entrapment.  I sent her 3 emails. she never responded to any.  I waited almost 2 weeks to see if she would respond before writing this review.  FIRST. I have lost trust in this company's ability to care or make it right. We have chosen to not offer anymore business with this buffet & all it's affiliates.  We arrive 45mins before reservation. online tells you show up 15 mins early. DO NOT. ARRIVE AN HOUR BEFORE. EXPECT TO WAIT IN 2 LINES (yes you wait in line to go to another line) Line 1 45 MINS & LINE 2 you wait another 10-15 mins.  SECOND. the food is not worth $94.99. Wynn Buffet is better if you're ok with less types of crab legs.  THIRD. the layout is such a maze & everyone was bumping into others which adds confusion to the order of where the line starts. where to begin. cutting through tables and your 90mins time. this may not seem important to others but when you have young children. it could be challenging.  FORTH. we had to wait almost 6 mins for sushi to come out. the crab legs & all desserts were low inventory. lines were so long. you end up in the way & disturbing others at their tables. it is unpleasant. GOOD RIDDANCE.  FYI we tipped a great happy server $50.,1,3,2,2,November 28 2024
Pros: There was a huge variety of food to accommodate every taste. The Asian dishes were mostly tasty and well prepared. The seafood had highs and lows - large prawns in shell were not overcooked and tasted sweet.  The brisket was nice. One in our group raved about the roast carrots.  Cons: The prime rib was fatty and ordinary. There were not enough vegetable dishes. We were expecting more Thanksgiving related items. but there weren’t any apart from dry turkey . No yams. no stuffing. no pie of any kind. The desserts were pretty. but flavorless and the lines for ice cream and crepes could not accommodate all those that wanted those options.  Biggest issue: The servers didn’t clear our plates. leaving no room on the table to get anything else. I had to find them twice to get them to clear them. As we are forced to tip in advance. there is no incentive to provide good service. Water glasses did not get refilled. There were no spoons available for soup or for ice cream. We felt hurried by the 90 minute time limit and having to wait in long lines for popular items meant we were rushed to eat when we finally got things and couldn’t enjoy our food.,3,3,1,1,November 28 2024
Despite inflation Bacchanal holds up its standards. I can only recommend this place if you want to spend some money. this is where you get your money’s worth and more. It’s just very popular and therefore always busy. Still a must go if you are in Vegas!,5,5,4,4,November 28 2024
Good food offering. Service okay. Atmosphere mediocre at best. One big room. What was very irritating was the time limit on a Wednesday. and how pushy they were in throwing you out. And why counting the Wednesday before thanksgiving as holiday and also increasing prices. In other words. could be good but our visit came with some aftertaste.,4,4,2,2,November 27 2024
Great items and familiar ones as well. A bit $$$$$ because it was a holiday! $94.99 + tax,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
Don’t even try and go here services sucks by far the worst ever ￼experience,1,1,1,1,November 27 2024
Great warm snow crab legs . very tasty!  Will come back.,4,4,4,4,November 27 2024
Aún con la reservación hay que hacer una fila de unos 43 minutos. Lleguen con anticipación para no perder la reservación.,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
Food was mainly delicious with just a few misses.  The wait to get in. even with a reservation. was unacceptable.  I probably wouldn’t go back for that reason.  We had a 5:00 reservation and waited in line for an hour before we were seated.,4,5,3,3,November 27 2024
They only give you 90min to eat. This is not enough time to experience the whole buffet. Had to wait 20 min at the carvery. Almost 30 min gone before I was  able to sit down and enjoy my 1st plate. 2 plate an more than an hour was gone and had to make my way to the deserts before we were booted out. Was very rushed and not able to savor the food or even have a conversation with my party. For $85 they need to give you at least 2hrs. Even if you ate nothing but crab you won't get your money's worth. Food was great though.,2,4,4,3,November 27 2024
I made a reservation but i couldn’t go inside. There was really long waiting line and i need to wait about 40min to 2hours. Even I made a reservation.. they did wrong reservation service.0,1,1,1,2,November 27 2024
the quality of the food was amazing. A little crowded but that is to be expected in Vegas at 5PM. The service and graciousness of the servers was fantastic!,4,5,5,3,November 27 2024
We reserved 4pm during weekday. The line for meats and dessert were extremely long. Among the 90 minutes. at least 30 minutes were spent on waiting in line. The beef brisket was good. All other meats were dry or tasteless. The lam was hard and cold probably because of not many people took. The crab legs were fresh and good. Overall it was not worth the price.,2,3,3,1,November 27 2024
Crowded. standing in line even WITH a reservation. chaos at the entrance and then having a 90 minute dining limit is not a good look. ￼The food was great. service was very good but it has the ambience of the Hunger Games. The 90 minute dining limit is demeaning considering with the tip you are paying over$220 for two people.  I felt like I had to rush to get food. eat it and get the hell out. I get to eat at my leisure even at damn Denny’s. I know the demand is high at Bacchanal’s and there have been previous issues with people overstaying their welcome but do better.,4,5,4,3,November 26 2024
It was ok the 90m to eat and get out was ridiculous because you are standing in very long lines waiting. We didn't get much time to eat. I get that there were people waiting but if you reserve atleast give them longer time. We never even got a chance to eat certain items. Then we tried desert you had to get things already made because there was not enough people working at the desert station. I wanted to enjoy it and not rush when we finally got to our table after waiting in long lines,3,2,5,3,November 26 2024
Very poorly run reservation system. No one on staff could provide any assistance or even estimate about wait time based upon spot in line. Staff did not frankly seem to care,1,1,1,1,November 26 2024
Had lots of food options and everything was delicious!!,5,5,5,5,November 26 2024
This place is totally overrated. Upon arrival. two separate people confirmed my reservation. then the hostess ushered us through the line very rudely. shouting back towards other waiting patrons asking how many were in their party. Constant shouting and filing people in with no regard for their position in line. Before entering. they ask for payment and a tip. The cashier was rude and acted like she was in a hurry as the machine forced me to select a tip amount minimum 18% before even being greeted by our server. When we were seated in her section. she practically yelled at the hostess that her shift was over and we shouldn’t have been sat there. She was inattentive and didn’t smile once the entire meal. Didn’t matter to her tip though since I had already left 20%. As far as the food. the only edible item was “hot” crab legs. I thought I’d try a little bit in every section and found that all the food items were either bland or unpleasant flavor. Even the little piece of toast with avocado topping was a combo of stale/burnt & cut the top of my mouth. I thought at least the desserts look decent but when I went for a small cake and macarons. I watched the man refilling the macarons bowl with what looked like the ones they sell at Costco. He was literally opening cardboard boxes and cutting the plastic packages to fill the bowl with macarons. Then when I reached to grab a tongs to serve myself one. he shouted at me to “hold up” several times. He came back with a different tongs and apologized to me saying he didn’t want me to use the wrong tongs. How incredibly rude he was. Anyway. we spent around $340 for the three of us to eat here. Also. part of the experience was that you’re given exactly 1.5 hours to eat. which does nothing but cause anxiety. As it turned out. we were out of there early. I’ve had similar quality food at a Chinese buffet for less than $15/person. Do not recommend Bacchanal Buffet and I certainly will not go back. Save your time and money.,1,1,1,1,November 26 2024
Quite a bit of the food was cold but what was warm was delicious,3,3,5,5,November 26 2024
So bad. Extremely dirty. Woman manager couldn’t be bothered to do anything but walk around with a pencil in her hand. I had to flag her down to ask if someone could take our stacked entree plates off the table so our family could eat dessert. She was aghast I had the audacity to ask. Then she takes 1/2 the plates and sets them on a dirty table next to us. Doesn’t come back to get the rest or get someone to do the same. Server who had that table curses under his breath as he watches her do it as he’s walking by our table. Real classy. Caesars. Bad food. filthy and bad employees. Never again.,1,2,1,1,November 26 2024
Our party received excellent service and was seated promptly when we arrived.  The food variety was excellent and offered something for everyone.,5,4,5,5,November 26 2024
It was an amazing experience. we enjoyed our food and the whole atmosphere.,5,5,5,5,November 26 2024
The line management was atrocious. What is the point of having a reservation if you have to wait in line for 40+ minutes and larger groups are seated before you? The food offerings and service was great. The seafood options were excellent. The meat carving stations leaned more towards quantity over quality.,5,5,5,4,November 26 2024
One of the best buffet in Vegas. Best attraction is the Alaskan crab leg.,5,5,5,3,November 26 2024
For the price the overall food quality was mediocre. Inconsistent temperatures with food sitting under heat lamps. Extremely poor service once seated. 20+ minutes and number requests just to get a glass of water.  Manager had to be flagged down to have water glasses refilled. Overall do not recommend.,2,3,1,3,November 26 2024
Expensive but still the best buffet in Vegas.  They say you have minutes to eat.  but that's plenty of time and we've never been asked to hurry.  Lines this week we're super long even though we had a reservation.,5,5,4,4,November 26 2024
Our server was very accommodating! The food was great. It was very busy but getting a table through OpenTable made it easy to get a group of 10 in very fast.,5,4,5,4,November 26 2024
Definitely over rated. The whole process of the reservations. to waiting in line was an annoyance. Food was good quality & had good taste. however entire dinner experience was underwhelming. You’re better off spending your money at an upscale restaurant. The buffet at the M resort was better.,3,3,2,2,November 26 2024
Easy seating for seniors and dad has mobility issues,5,4,4,3,November 25 2024
While the food was good and fresh - I noticed my server was attentive and efficient - for being a buffet - the service stood out ! Thank you we will go again,5,5,5,4,November 25 2024
Deception!! It was good but not anymore! The service is not good,4,3,2,4,November 25 2024
It was alright. nothing out of this world. Definitely a lot if food/ options. but a lot were a miss,3,3,5,3,November 25 2024
Waitress was watching our time limit while my family at the other table was not and able to just enjoy  the their holiday meal.,5,5,2,5,November 25 2024
Go twice a year. taste of food quality going down. not slightly. just not as good as last time. Service still excellent.,3,3,3,3,November 25 2024
The waiter was very attentive and even brought me a nice surprise treat for my birthday.,5,5,5,5,November 25 2024
If you make a reservation and still don’t mind standing in line. this place is for you.  It’s a super expensive buffet with super options but come hungry and willing to try everything or it’s not worth the money.  Don’t be discouraged if you are number 115 on the wait list. takes awhile but we still got in!,4,5,4,3,November 25 2024
We did not have to wait with our OpenTable reservations. They walked us right to the back and we felt like royalty. So many stations to choose from and all have great choices and yummy food. Our favorite had to be the desert station. Wow … I would say they had about 40 different deserts for all to enjoy. It is a buffet worth trying.,5,5,5,5,November 25 2024
Wait line is extremely long. way too high price compared to food quality. short staffing. taking forever to clean dishes. the only good thing was our waitress who knows what to do and serve with smile. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SU!!!!!,1,1,4,1,November 25 2024
Lobster claws were dry and not fresh.  Best prime rib and cheesy mashed potatoes I’ve ever had.,4,4,4,4,November 25 2024
Arrived 40min prior to reservation to begin check -in which too 4min. the wait was 30min to be seated. no issues. Food was good ( minus macaroni). I'd return.,5,5,5,5,November 25 2024
The lobster claws were awful and tasteless. It took forever to get a cracker for the crab legs although they were decent. The wagyu beef was not even listed but when I finally got some it did not taste very good. Service was very poor and it was loud and overpriced,2,2,1,1,November 25 2024
Great selection of food but the check in line are way too long even already made reservations,4,5,3,4,November 25 2024
We really enjoyed the variety of food and I was impressed by the dessert section. But our server was not attentive and forgot our drinks.,4,5,3,4,November 25 2024
Love going to this buffet. It’s expensive but you are also getting a unique food experience. with opportunities to try so many things. The quality is amazing and the variety is out of this world!,5,5,5,5,November 25 2024
Ambience - Great place for large parties. Able to talk with guests without shouting.  Service - Good. All party must be present to be seated.  Food - Quality of food and option has decreased since 2022. Lobster claw was dry and rubbery.,3,3,4,5,November 24 2024
food wasn't as fresh as before.  I've been the restaurant many times.,3,2,5,3,November 24 2024
Amazing food and great service. I would come again,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
Food was ok. Lots of varieties but not any item particularly tasty in an impressive way. Kids like it though.,3,3,3,4,November 24 2024
La calidad y variedad de los alimentos es magnífica.,5,5,4,5,November 24 2024
Service was slow. They are clearly understaffed. Piles of dirty dishes on tables lingered. Services for drinks was slow. They need to stop asking for tips prior to be served. Food was not hot enough,4,4,3,4,November 24 2024
Was impressed with the vast selection of food to choose from. Everything tasted great. will go again next time we are in Vegas.,4,5,4,4,November 24 2024
It was a bit pricey but over all the food was excellent. would like to have lobster 🦞 tails next time.,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
So much food to choose from.  Some of it was cold and unfortunately was not good.  Crab legs were great as was the prime rib. Desserts were amazing and pletny of choice.,5,4,3,4,November 24 2024
Lots of choices but the quality was very much ok…,3,3,3,3,November 24 2024
Omg sook good. Totally worth the money. Food is outstanding! I recommend to pre book a table as the wait times can be very long.,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
Food sucks and so does service. Better to go to restaurant instead. Seafood taste like tap water. meat section is lacking and overcooked.,1,1,1,3,November 24 2024
The food is delicious. lot of variety. It is a bit pricey for brunch and even with reservation we had to wait 40 minutes in line between to first pay and then wait to be seated.,5,5,4,5,November 23 2024
The food is still fantastic overall. My only complaint is how the cold crabs are served as of late. A couple years ago they were not as watery and you were able to take the meat out a little easier. Now. they seem to be defrosted in a way where it is more stringy and watery which makes for a messy experience. Some food like the pizza tasted like it was sitting around for a while. Some stations should be  checked for freshness.,4,4,5,5,November 23 2024
This was the best part of our stay in Las Vegas and we were here for the F1 race! Loved the all you can eat snow crab and prime rib and shrimp! I think I ate my weight in snow crab lol.,5,5,5,5,November 23 2024
Overrated - for being the #1 buffet in Vegas it was disappointing. The selection of food was superb. but the temperature and flavor was lacking. Hot foods were like warm at best and most items were dry and had been under heat lamps for quite a while. And not having a bottomless mimosas was unacceptable. Definitely NOT worth the price paid.,3,3,4,4,November 23 2024
Liked that there was many options to select from but honestly it was overpriced. The hype it gets from social media is also overrated. This is my opinion for the experience. Try it yourself to form yours. ￼,3,4,3,4,November 23 2024
The food is amazing. the service was awesome. and the presentation was phenomenal. I truly enjoyed myself. I am sure to go again.,5,5,5,5,November 23 2024
Great buffet with lots of choices for most any taste/diet/preference. The seafood selections were amazing and the small plates made it so that you could try lots of dishes and flavors. Our favorite part was the selection of desserts. The egg-creams were literally the best we've ever had. We would even go back just for the egg-creams. We highly recommend making reservations.,5,5,5,4,November 23 2024
The buffet was excellent. and I enjoyed all the various choices on the menu. I am a seafood person so I was in heaven. I ate during the Saturday brunch. and it wasn't that busy.,5,5,5,5,November 23 2024
Excellent Buffett! Worth every penny! We eat here every time we are in town? Keep up the good work!,5,5,4,4,November 23 2024
Noy bad. It depends on the table server that day.,3,4,3,4,November 22 2024
It was just fine. Food was mediocre. It was just an overrated place but really there’s more better place to eat in vegas. We were just there for the experience and hype. but probably wont be back there since we ate there already.,3,3,3,3,November 22 2024
Service was good but the food was only mediocre . The ambience reminded me of a coffee shop which does not reflect Caesar’s Palace’s reputation . There was an abundance of food and I did not try everything because there was not enough time. The guests were given  90 minutes to dine. I skipped the Mexican section and did not eat any dessert.  The  Bacchanel Buffet is supposed to have an outstanding seafood section which was not reflected when I dined there. All of the shrimp dishes I sampled did not taste that they were fresh. Likewise the lox was also soft not firm. The clams and mussels did not look appealing. Further the prime rib was dry. The dim sum section was about the best but the Asian section was also disappointing otherwise.  The buffet regularly cost $100. I got an early bird 20% discount since I started before 10:00 AM. The food’s quality must not wary because of the time a guest eats. I will not be returning.,3,2,4,3,November 22 2024
Be aware that you are held to a 90 minute time frame.  We weren’t told about the rule until we tan out of time.  Otherwise. the wait staff and food were good.,4,5,5,5,November 22 2024
The food was unreal! They have a little bit of everything. so you really need to look first and decide after. otherwise you’ll miss a lot! There’s something for everyone. We took our friends here to celebrate after our wedding. and we couldn’t have picked a better place! Is perfect to celebrate things like that ❤️,5,5,5,5,November 22 2024
Attentive staff. Great food. Correct temperature. And attentive to allergies.,5,5,5,5,November 22 2024
Horrible desserts. but creme brulee is the only good. oh . and Oreo,5,3,5,5,November 22 2024
Great selection and the service was excellent. Save room for dessert.,5,5,5,5,November 22 2024
celebrating my 50th and sons 21st on the same day and was so happy with everything but our server was the worst. we were 13 ppl in all and we had to look for him and he to be told to clean our plates. he accidentally spilt a drink on 2 ppl in party but that’s. ok but he just was not helpful and made our experience less enjoyable. food and ambience was great and other staff around us were friendly and helpful,4,5,1,5,November 22 2024
The food lay out is too confusing. The prime rib was dry.clams just shells no meat.,1,1,3,2,November 22 2024
Very elegant atmosphere. great quality and variety of foods. friendly staff and cooks. Will come again.,5,5,5,5,November 22 2024
This place is definitely a visit Everytime I visit! V_s,5,4,5,4,November 21 2024
El buffet en calidad de comida es bueno. los mariscos muy buenos. lo demás regular. las bebidas. el vino francamente malo.,3,4,2,1,November 21 2024
When entering the restaurant I noticed many unclean tables and food droppings on the floor. Immediately that was a turn off for me. The variety of food was great. However. the quality could have been better as it relates to certain foods(eg) seafood. I found the crab legs to be rather small. and I didn’t like the claws seemed overcooked. I am pescatarian and I didn’t see a a variety of fresh fish mostly just shellfish and  small salmon portions. The food temperature was above warm not hot. The mash potatoes and vegetables were fantastic! I liked the gelato for dessert that was the only item that caught my attention everything else seemed standard as a low cost buffet. The server was extremely nice. The cost was $92.00 per person that includes tax.  If you do not eat a lot of food. I would suggest a sit down restaurant with better quality of food for the price you pay;even if it cost a little more money at least you will be satisfied.,4,4,5,2,November 21 2024
No worth the money it all. it was horrible. food cold and no good.,1,1,1,1,November 21 2024
The reservation means absolutely nothing you have to wait in a line (with people without reservations) prior to even checking in and at least another 20 minutes prior to getting sat. Staff is rude and we only had our water filled once when we sat and never saw a server again.  Food is good if you like seafood. otherwise I wouldn’t bother a waste of money and time.,3,3,1,2,November 21 2024
The price for this was absurd. I don't mind paying for extravagance but this was ridiculous,2,3,1,3,November 21 2024
The food was amazing! Staff was friendly.  Reservations are the way to go. Only suggestion I have would be not to make them at 4pm because you will wait in line due to change from brunch to dinner.,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
Had a great time here! Loved how there were so many food options. there was definitely something for everyone. We were amazed at the quality and variety of the dishes. The seafood alone made it worth it- we couldn't believe how much they had to offer; lobster claws. snow crab legs. oysters. mussels. whelk. shrimp. and more! It is pricey. but worth it. Definitely a highlight of our trip.,5,5,5,5,November 20 2024
This place has gone downhill in the past couple years. Food was not good and service was even worse.,1,1,1,1,November 20 2024
Some choices were top notch- others mediocre at best.  But overall it was good.  Desserts seemed to be lacking.,4,4,4,4,November 20 2024
It was very good. great food. A lot of different food and desserts.,4,5,4,4,November 20 2024
I’m not quite sure about value for the price if you decide to not go crazy for the most expensive items. but the variety and more traditional foods are absolutely stunning both in presentation and quality.,5,5,4,5,November 20 2024
There was a variety of foods. All foods were tasty and presented in a sanitary manner. This buffet place is one of the reasons I am going to Vegas.,5,5,5,5,November 19 2024
Food was great! Service was good and staff was friendly!,5,5,5,5,November 19 2024
We were told to add to the waitlist and it could be about an hour. We were #46. After an hour. we moved up to 45. After 3 hours. #43. Our number was never called. Terrible customer service.,1,1,1,1,November 19 2024
Unbelievable choice of food and quality is amazing. This will feed all your senses as staff is dedicated to make you having an extraordinary culinary experience. And considering the average dish price in all restaurants around. price of the buffet is very reasonable. Will get back next time we will be in Vegas!,5,5,4,5,November 19 2024
I left full and satisfied. Waiter was amazing. Food was great. If you got the money. it is worth it.  Please do make a reservation and show up early as it gets VERY busy.,5,5,5,5,November 19 2024
Great selection but was pretty noisy. Small waiting time after reservation time,5,5,5,5,November 19 2024
Decent buffet. Overpriced for sure. For the price there should be lobster tails as well. Probably will not return. Ambiance is nice though.,2,2,2,5,November 19 2024
The lines were long. the little portions on little plates is waisting time. Cold seafood area was nasty.,1,1,1,1,November 19 2024
Food is always good  Prime Rib was not as good as usual kind of “grisly “  More warm crab claws along with the legs,5,4,5,3,November 19 2024
Overall. the service was great. and we appreciated the effort put into making our experience enjoyable. While the food variety was good. the dessert selection was not extraordinary. Additionally. our group felt a bit rushed due to the time constraints. Furthermore. we felt that the cost did not fit the value provided.,4,4,5,4,November 19 2024
Great atmosphere. great food overall. Only let down was seafood was ok not great but everything else was really good,4,4,5,5,November 19 2024
Pros - Our server was great!  Very attentive and never had to ask for refills since he took care of it before us asking.  Cons - Oh. what a disappointment!!!  Let me start by saying. hot food is always hot. and cold food is always cold; and that's about it.  Not enough selections other than seafood seafood seafood.  No bread not soup station.  The dessert station was a joke.  I took a variety of little cake sampler and none of them was good.  Fruits were terrible.  The ice cream station and mochi donut were good.  I didn't try the crepe.   Totally overrated!,2,1,5,3,November 18 2024
If you are serving sushi. some other sauces would be nice rather than the packaged soy sauce.  I dropped a small poke plate and the waitress gave me a wipe to clean it up myself.,4,4,4,4,November 18 2024
Had a 2:30 pm reservation and had to stand in line for an hour. because they were only seating groups of 4.  When we finally got in. there were tons of empty tables. I think there is a staffing problem.   I do not understand the point of a reservation when you have to stand there for an hour. at least provide seating.   The food was great. especially the desserts.  There is a great selection of seafood and meat entrees.,4,3,4,3,November 18 2024
I usually only write good reviews and am a very positive  person we spend thousands a month eating out any where from fast foods to elegant steak houses.  My husband and I were very excited to try one of the supposedly best buffets in Vegas. We made a reservation for 2:30  they sat us at 3:00 which we did not mind. Once we sat down a server asked what we wanted to drink we asked for a wine list she brought it immediately but did not come back for 20 minutes. We ordered the pitcher of mimosa the menu said $40 . A different girl came over and brought a check for $69 I questioned her about the amount she said cause it had juice We did not argue but mimosas do have juice  which they put in it themselves. We proceeded to the buffets almost every single thing was cold as they  said they were getting ready to put out the warm food for dinner at 4. The only 2 things edible were the crab and prime rib which was delicious . I could not crack the crab as they were whole legs had to wait 10 minutes for a server to ask for a cracker to open them she did not come back as we sat there another 10 minutes waiting could not eat without them finally my husband got up and asked another person at a different station for some they brought them  over 5 minutes later we did not even start eating until 3:40 .  My husband got up to go to the bathroom at 4:20 while I was waiting for him at the table finishing my drink  at 4:34  a man came over and told us our 90 minutes were up and we had to leave . Our bill was $85 a piece  we left in advance  a $35 tip also left another $15 tip for mimosa. This is way over priced and over rated 90 we were still  hungry when we left .  I recommend for the price go to a nice steak house and enjoy the meal.,3,2,2,4,November 18 2024
Terrible for the price ! Long line not worth it go to the Wynn,1,1,1,1,November 18 2024
Me lo esperaba mejor . la carne fría y chiclosa. Esperaba platillos más creativos o diferentes . Mínimo para el precio esperaba que la comida estuviera caliente.,2,2,4,4,November 18 2024
It was an amazing day experience. From the wait time (which is to be expected and them handling this logistics nightmare with different access levels and priorities so well) to the variety and freshness of the food and the great service l. it was absolutely amazing. It wasn't too busy at the crab brunch on a Monday. with reservation I waited only 20 minutes to be seated. My server was very fast. kind and attentive. Everyone working the buffet was amazing as well and tried to make your experience special and unique. The quality of the food was amazing. the prime rib medium rare and tender. the brisket juicy. melt in your mouth and flavorful. The king crab legs were plenty and replenished often. One secret meat that probably gets overlooked often at the Asian section: the duck! So delicious and juicy and just perfection! Don't sleep on it! Next to all the savory food the desserts were phenomenal as well. Crepes made to order were spectacular. the ice cream bar delicious and all the little cake slices made you feel you didn't eat that much dessert (yeah right... 😁 ). The macaroons deserve a special mention. They were far better than other macaroons that I paid a lot of money for before! Next time las Vegas I'll definitely be back here!,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
The waiter was busy helping with who can speak his own language. other people always got the water and clean the table first. like 2:1. the foods were ok but with the price you pay for was not worth for it. Lunch was expensive and no crab served until the end of the time... do not intent to go back in the future at all.,3,3,2,2,November 18 2024
Great experience with our team member Sandra Williams being professional and kind with assisting us while we dined.  The only thing that i would critic is some of the food being served was cold on the buffet line and did not maintain the recommended temperatures of serving hot food. For the price of the buffet I expected the food to be at least hot/moderately warm that is served on the buffet line.,4,4,5,4,November 18 2024
Best buffet ever. They have a wide variety of food to accommodate everyone .,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
The food wasn’t as good as the last 2 times I was there. The people next to me were saying the same thing to me when we were chatting.,3,2,4,4,November 18 2024
This restaurant is too famous and truly unrivaled. so they treat customers like trash. Our family of four wanted to enjoy dinner because it was a family member’s birthday. We arrived at 6:00 PM and got in line. When it was our turn to meet the representative. we were told they were no longer accepting diners. They told us to scan the board and join the waitlist if we wanted. I tried scanning and registered on the waitlist as number 150. I kept checking for updates on the waitlist until 9:00 PM. and we were still at 147. I understand they are overcrowded. but they shouldn’t disrespect customers like this.,1,5,1,1,November 18 2024
My husband And I got 30 minutes after the last dish. Ne ver again.,2,1,2,1,November 18 2024
So large. I could not get everything I wanted. The variety is the best on strip. The warm snow cab was amazing and always available.,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
Everything during my experience was great. Some of the food items liked a bit of quality. though the pasta station marinara sauce was kind of sweet. I expected a little bit better quality. ￼,4,4,5,5,November 18 2024
Delicious options. I got full just looking at it all,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
It was ok but they advertise it showing king crab. lobster. snails and other items which you discover aren’t on the menu. Prime rib was fine but had no flavor. Dessert table had no options for diabetics,3,3,2,4,November 18 2024
Love the buffet here. Our waiter was awesome. very attentive,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
Fake reservation system. They require everyone to make reservation. then let everyone wait in line for at least one hour unless you are a higher tier member tier memember.,1,1,1,1,November 18 2024
The buffet was overrated. we had reservations and still had to wait 45 minutes with the people that didn’t have reservations. we were in the same line  The pizza bar was old and not one item was replaced or refilled for the hour that we were there  The salad bar was a sad excuse The hamburger sliders I got 3 different ones and they were all undercooked pink not edible to eat  The dessert bar was terrible  Crab legs looked good but there were so many people taking plates and plates of them  Prime rib was all fat  The Chinese food was ok. but there was nothing worth $190  The Wynn’s is far superior,1,1,1,1,November 18 2024
Disappointing experience and not worth the money. The idea of an unlimited buffet sounds appealing. but the food quality was subpar. Despite having a reservation. we waited 40 minutes to be seated. even though there were plenty of empty tables—this seemed more like a marketing tactic than an actual shortage of space. To make things worse. they requested a tip before we were even seated. Once at the table. the service was painfully slow. My friends and I regretted our decision to dine here—it felt like a complete waste of both time and money. I wouldn’t recommend it and definitely won’t be returning.,2,2,2,3,November 17 2024
Good good overall. crab legs and dim sum especially. Desserts were average to below. Expensive though $180+ for two people at 2pm.,4,4,4,4,November 17 2024
Food is always delicious! This is my top buffet in Vegas. The customer service is also amazing! Shout out to Sonia R. . Edgar. and Ed! Great host and managers!,5,5,5,5,November 17 2024
Not worth the cost. the food quality was horrible. The seafood was not fresh. The lobster claws had mushy meat and I got hives shortly after eating. Big let down after so much hype.,1,1,5,3,November 17 2024
After all that hype that one must try Bacchanal. it was a disappointing experience. The seafood selection is crab. crab and crab. No varieties of fish. The sushi was mediocre.,3,3,3,3,November 17 2024
If u can't find something u like to eat at this buffet then it is not worth eating.  So many stations and such a variety with the warm food always warm.  I always stop for this buffet each time we visit,5,5,5,5,November 17 2024
Everything I ate was delicious. prime rib for lunch? I’m so down!,5,5,5,5,November 17 2024
While serving poor quality and cold food is always bad. the cost of 84.99$ per person makes it all the more outrageous!  Add the long lines for some counters and the 90 minute time limit and you have an extremely disappointing experience.,1,1,2,4,November 17 2024
"Food that was offered is good. but not great. All dishes were kept to be ""Basic"".",4,3,4,4,November 17 2024
I don't recommend late reservations. Foods look messy and old. We went in @ 9:45 and was told they will stop serving food at 10:00. so we end up taking left over foods. We choose the place hoping food was abundant no matter what time you go in. With the price we paid per head. we deserve same quality of food no matter how late the reserved time is. So disappointed and will not recommend the place to relatives and friends...,3,2,3,3,November 17 2024
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$&&&nesst day ever,5,5,5,5,November 17 2024
Great food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,5,5,5,November 17 2024
Terrible wait system. The lady at the front desk basically said we don't know how long the wait will be. It's sad that this is the only buffet that can't give you a wait time. For a place that uses a fancy wait system you would think they would be able to generate something that tells you how many people are in front of you. Will never come here again.,1,1,1,1,November 17 2024
Great foods and great service. waiting is not too bad because we have reservation.,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
Buena selección y con la reservación por la aplicación no tardamos mucho para pasar al comedor...,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
Extremely overcrowded. loud. and absolutely terrible service. You have to wait for a server to come to your table to get any drink. It was more than 30 minutes before this happened. The food is good. but you could spend $100 anywhere else and get great food too. ￼,2,4,1,1,November 16 2024
Many great food options to try Rather long wait to get in with reservation Long wait for drink order Overall fun time,5,5,4,3,November 16 2024
We love the ambiance and the variety of food and desserts to chose from. There is literally something for everyone! The staff is friendly and provided great service. We had a party if 9 and everything went smoothly. This was my husband’s and I second time eating at the Bacchanal and we will return again.,5,5,4,5,November 16 2024
Servers did not work very hard to put 2 tables of 4 next to each other even though there were many tables available,3,3,3,3,November 16 2024
Great buffet. tasty options.  All you can eat crab legs!,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
I feel that the time limit of 90 minutes was in the back of my mind the entire time making me not able to enjoy the delicious food and I felt rushed the entire time. I was not able to enjoy all of the food stations because of this.  This was the consensus of the party.,2,4,4,1,November 16 2024
This was my second time coming here but my husband’s first and it did not disappoint! Will definitely be back the next time around,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
Food was fantastic! Was even surprised at how good the pho broth was!,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
Very extensive buffet that will have something for nearly anyone in your party.  However. only a few items met the ‘flavor’ expectation.  Our waitress did keep our beverages refilled.   Overall only mediocre given the $80+ price tag per person.,3,2,3,2,November 15 2024
The crab was the star of the show. When the line for crab got too long. a server carted out a another cart of hot crab legs and served them nearby while another server replenished the crab station. The line didn't really get roo long compared to other places I've been. The rest of the buffet was really nice and kept reasonably fresh. The server came by consistently to check on us. I don't think I ate $80 worth of food but the selection made it worth while. I would come back for sure.,4,4,4,4,November 15 2024
Excellent service in a great atmosphere. Food is delicious. My frien my friend and  my kids  enjoyed !!,5,5,5,5,November 15 2024
If you're looking to save a bit of cash. take advantage of the 20% discount offered at specific times in the morning through Open Table.   We went here twice during our visit - once for supper and once for breakfast/brunch.  While there were some differences in what was being offered at the two services. it wasn't so drastic that you would miss anything if you just wanted to try it once.  The buffet is massive.  There are countless options that will no doubt satisfy everyone's palette.  My favorite was the offering of seafood. Crab legs were the biggest draw for most. but I liked being able to try a few things new to me. Like the whelks!   Two other favorites were the desserts and the incorporation of drinks around the buffet. The Ube Hochata is not to be missed and the Thai Tea around the dessert station was some of the best I've had.  If you've never been. definitely put Bacchanal on the list to try.  You won't be disappointed. and if you're like us it will be on the list for your return visits as well!,5,5,5,5,November 15 2024
Over the top selection of foods .  Largest buffet that I had ever seen  Appears expensive at $85 per person but in Las Vegas that is not an expensive meal. so this is a great way to eat a wide variety.,5,5,5,3,November 15 2024
My husband and I came here during our honeymoon. it’s was *chefs kiss* 🤌🏽! Highly recommend! I will say it’s on the pricy side but you get over 250 options of different foods!,5,5,5,5,November 15 2024
Amazing food and reasonable price. The service was nice.,5,5,5,5,November 15 2024
The only thing that was good on their bar was their crab legs. Everything else was just OK. The lobster did not have good flavor or texture.,2,2,2,2,November 15 2024
We were there last week. We decided to have dinner there to celebrate my dad's birthday. There was so many food to choose from. The salmon was excellent!!! The desserts bar has a lot of selections to choose from. Plus there are vegan options.,5,5,5,5,November 15 2024
We really enjoyed the crab legs.  There was also many other food options like Mexican Chinese Italian and a variety of meats.  The deserts had a lot of options also and was very good.  Overall we really enjoyed the buffet.,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
It was great. I try to eat there every time I go to Vegas. It’s expensive to eat on the strip and if I’m going to drop $100 on a meal this is the place.,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
Recently visited Bacchanal Buffet with my mother. and it continues to exceed expectations since my first visit in 2019. This upscale buffet stands out even among Las Vegas's competitive dining scene. The 90-minute dining window provides access to an impressive array of high-quality dishes across multiple cuisines.  Food Highlights: - Fresh seafood station featuring crab legs. shrimp. mussels. and clams - Extensive selection of American. Latin. and Asian cuisines - Premium dessert station - Complimentary non-alcoholic beverages  Reservations are essential. particularly for dinner service. Brunch tends to be less crowded but equally impressive. While the price point is higher than typical buffets. the quality and variety justify the cost.  You have to come with an appetite! The selection is vast. and you'll want to sample as much as possible during your allotted time.,5,5,5,4,November 14 2024
Unbelievable food!! You think it- they have it.  Presentation is everything and they do a fabulous job! Of course. you pay dearly for it; but you are on vacation and it's worth it once in a while! Every nationality of food represented and it's all delicious!! Highly recommend!!,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
Good food good place to hangout with friends and family,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
La calidad a bajado y se nota Deberían cuidar eso. Y mejorar servicio de meseros,3,3,3,3,November 14 2024
The quality and variety was great. And the food tasted quite good but not spectacular. That’s what you would expect from a buffet.,4,4,4,5,November 14 2024
Was so excited to go hearing it's one of the best buffets on the strip. but the food just wasn't good and especially not for the price. Edible. yes. but the only thing that was enjoyable was the mashed potatoes. 1/10 Wouldn't recommend.,4,2,3,5,November 14 2024
Das Essen ist lecker und das Angebot fast unschlagbar gut. Trotz Reservierung lange Wartezeit. Alles unglaublich voll.,4,5,4,5,November 14 2024
The buffet was phenomenal. So much to choose from. The quality of the food was fresh and delicious!,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
A bit pricey but I think with the variety of selections was worth it!  If you love seafood this is the buffet for you!!! Great lobster claws. shrimp. scallops. etc.  One downside they put a 90 minute time limit to eat. I didn't feel forced....so take your chances you're in a gambling town :),4,4,4,4,November 14 2024
As usual. Bacchanal Buffet did not disappoint.  With 7 in our party. there was enough of a selection that everyone was pleased.  Some say it’s pricey. but I have always felt it was worth the money.  Everything always tastes so fresh and there is a good amount of seafood dishes including both hot and cold crab legs.,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
The  Bacchanal Buffet is my family’s favorite buffet in Las Vegas! There is always a large variety of selections to choose from. especially if you have picky eaters in your group. Everyone in my family always leaves there feeling satisfied and happy. Even though the price of the buffet is comparatively high to others in Las Vegas. it is worth every penny. It is the one place that we will always splurge on and come back to.,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
For the price it wasn’t a good value. Most of the hot items were temped or cold. The prime rib tasted like cold cut beef and had a mushy texture. The crab legs were also mushy. Many items were totally inedible being extremely bland or cold. Visually the buffet looks nice but the actual food was sub par and not well made. specifically the desserts. All in all it seems like a $25 buffet dressed up to appear expensive and elegant. Food was a 3/10. The 90 minute limit made the atmosphere hectic and not relaxing. I’m a career chef and don’t generally write reviews but I was extremely disappointed since the buffet was one of the highlights of the Vegas trip.,1,1,3,1,November 13 2024
Large amount of choices but not many vegetarian options. Expensive in cost but service was excellent and a very clean place.,3,3,4,4,November 12 2024
As buffets go it was good. However I did not find the seafood anything special. And red meats were above average as were the deserts,3,3,4,3,November 12 2024
The seafood was over cooked. Great selection but definitely not an 85 dollar meal. Our server was outstanding. Next time I’d try it for lunch instead. Would rather spend 100 dollars at a nice steak house for dinner.,3,3,4,4,November 12 2024
The best buffet of the buffets that reopened in Vegas.  The food and selection is excellent.  Coffee is so smooth.  Crab was great!,5,5,3,3,November 12 2024
On Tuesday 11/12 me and my partner made a reservation for the Buffet. We heard about one price online but were given a completely different one in-person. It caught us off guard but we still decided to try it out. The cashier was inpatient and was rushing us to make a decision whether to stay or go somewhere else. She kept repeating “So cancel?” Please do not rush anyone like that ever again. Our first and last experience visiting this Buffet. A manager came up to us and offered 2 glasses of free champagne which we appreciate it! Doesn’t change the fact that we were disappointed in the service.,2,5,1,2,November 12 2024
The supervisor or manager that seated was super rude.,1,2,1,1,November 12 2024
Great food. great choices. great value. I eat gluten-free and had no problem finding what I could eat.,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
"Make a reservation! We did and were seated fairly quickly. The food display. freshness. taste are all amazing. A server said it's basically nine restaurants in one. It is not a typical ""buffet"". Save room for dessert!",4,5,5,5,November 12 2024
Great food great options. reasonable price for what you get. The only annoying thing is is that you have to make a reservation when there was no one standing in line,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
My group did not have a good experience. The staff was rude and high demand foods (like crab legs)  were out....creating frustration and lines at a restaurant that had a time limit.,1,3,1,3,November 11 2024
Amazing and fun selection! The price is a little steep. but considering all the time and effort it takes for them to offer such a expansive selection it’s worth it!,5,4,4,4,November 11 2024
You can use a better Filipino chef. The Filipino dishes served did not meet the authentic and well representation and taste of a good Filipino food to be served to varied nationals especially those who haven’t tasted Filipino cuisine.,4,4,4,4,November 11 2024
Excelente todo. desde la atención. servicio y sobre todo la comida. Gran variedad y todo de muy buena calidad. Para mi. dentro de los mejores buffets de Las Vegas sin duda.,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
Uno de los buffetes más grandes. rico y variados que he conocido.,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
The best item was the salmon bagel. Everything else was just average. Liked the small portion sizes of desserts,3,3,4,4,November 11 2024
Great buffet with just about everything you could want. Can't wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
INCREDIBLE 10/10 will go again - definitely adding this to all future LV trip itineraries,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
Good variety of food and everything tasted great.  Wait staff were attentive and friendly.,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
Mucha gente. No respetan las reservaciones. Ni siquiera nos preguntaron el nombre ni el numero de reservacion.,3,5,3,5,November 11 2024
Definitely a huge selection of good food.  Snow crab is good. but the lobster claws are not fresh.  Dessert section could use more sugar free options. and it would be nice to have sashimi instead of just sushi.,4,4,3,3,November 11 2024
Obviously. there was a lot of food at the buffet. and everything I chose was excellent. The problem was the long waiting times before enjoying our food. We made reservations well in advance. but we had to wait in line to get to the reservation desk. We then waited in line to get inside the restaurant. We then waited in line at the various food pick-up areas. I enjoyed the experience. but this will probably be a one-time shot for me.,4,5,5,4,November 11 2024
By far the best buffet in town. This not just a buffet. It’s an experience. The quality of the food. the atmosphere and the attention to detail the staff provide. It’s a five star experience.,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
Great food. But some of the dishes were cold or at a room temperature and should have been hotter. For the price range I think it was overpriced. Parking was $25 plus the long walk towards the restaurant. Around $90 per person plus tip to your server.  The best dishes were. the bone marrow. crab legs. steamed dumplings. sashimi and a few dessert items.  Overall 7 out of 10.,4,3,5,4,November 11 2024
Waited 45 minutes for a table after our reservation time.  Food was good however wish we would have known we would have to wait that long after our reservation.,4,5,3,3,November 10 2024
The food is excellent.  Chef prepared and unique offerings.  However. the service lacks a bit of attention as the drinks sat empty too long.  We had to chase down server to get refills.  And if you make a reservation. be prepared to be welcomed with a nod to go stand in line.  Meaning. you will most likely not be seated at your reservation time.  So if you have a show to go to and you are counting on a reservation time. be advised they do not seat you right away just because you have a reservation. and you can wait 30 minutes or longer.  This is not right and they should explain that to customers  ahead of time so they do not have issues with their schedules.,2,5,2,3,November 10 2024
If you love seafood. this is the place to go! The buffet also features sooo many different kinds of cuisine. there is something enjoyable for everyone,5,5,5,4,November 10 2024
Preface this review with we have been here several times over years.  This buffet USED to be a high end buffet.  It is no longer this.  Food is primarily COLD. nothing fresh other than made to order.  The SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  Management does not care. we asked to speak to one during our visit. no one ever showed up.  Took 15 minutes for a coffee. plates left on table during visit. only picked up one time! We went for brunch which has been our favorite. Every Egg. meat. potato dish was either COLD AND SOGGY. or luke warm.  Yes its a buffet. yes its sitting out. but there is a way to serve that ensures food is fresh and warm.  Chiliquiles. completely soggy and wet chips. hash browns COLD. mini sandwiches soggy and COLD. The restaurant is showing its age. wear and tear. bathrooms disgusting. bathroom attendant sitting at door waiting for you to step out. just an awkward experience for $250 for 2 diners. Overall unfortunately we will never return. it was a Ole Country buffet on a bad day. Go to the Wynn Buffet. they have surpassed this in every way. and if you are looking for a proper Las Vegas buffet. the Wynn is it. Save your money. DO NOT GO HERE.  IT'S OVER at the Bacchanal....,2,2,1,1,November 10 2024
The food and myriad of food choices were excellent!  Everything was prepared to perfection!   The price was was well worth it.   My only complaint is the 90 minute time limit is not long enough for this type of high end buffet.  The time limit should be increased to 2 hours.,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
I enjoyed the prime rib and the ham.  Buffett is a little pricey.  Overall. I like the restaurant. it’s nice and not noisy.,5,4,5,5,November 10 2024
This is a must do for every trip I make to Vegas! It's so good!,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
Great food ! We will be back! Thanks so much for a great time !,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
Wish there were more seafood selections such as Dungeness crab not the small claws they had.,4,4,5,4,November 9 2024
Food selection and service was amazing. A few items were a bit cold though (French toast station). It’s more expensive than most buffets in Vegas.,4,4,5,4,November 9 2024
We’ve been here many times and as usual. the food was outstanding. though the Dungeness crab legs were very small this time. For the weekend brunch. did not see the bone marrow. Prime rib was outstanding as were the Birria tacos. Maria. our server. was excellent and efficient!  However. I did encounter an issue with payment in the beginning. I saw an offer of 20% off if coming in for the weekend brunch between 9 am and 1030 am (I had reservations for 6 people at 10 am on Saturday. 11/9/24) for $64.99. When I showed the cashier the offer (I took a screenshot of the offer). Caesar’s did not honor the offer. saying they change all the time. Since I was with guests. I did not seek out management and put up an argument to seek clarification.  I think management should honor their offers that are on line. especially when I have a screenshot from Open Table.,4,4,5,5,November 9 2024
Excelente muy bien todos los Servicios prestwdos dentro del lugar,5,4,5,4,November 9 2024
the system they were using to let people in wasn't good. i understand they cater to and give priority to their higher level gamblers but normal people with a reservation were having to wait an hour to be seated and they were bringing people in from the normal reservation by the size of their party which made things move along even slower and the people who had been waiting longer got seated after. after my wife and I were finally seated it was at was appeared to be a children's table and by the time we got another plate of food our original plates were still sitting there with no room to put our new plates. probably one of the worst experiences we've ever had at this buffet.,4,4,4,4,November 9 2024
Maher was great! The food was amazing and the experience was excellent!,5,4,5,5,November 8 2024
The food was great. We really enjoyed the selection.,5,5,4,4,November 8 2024
Wonderful! Really enjoyed it and I’m not a seafood lover.,5,5,5,5,November 8 2024
Stations were clean and food is excellent! 2nd time going and will be back!,5,5,5,5,November 8 2024
Relatively long wait to be seated. Amazing food variety and quality. A bit noisy,5,5,5,4,November 8 2024
The food is always excellent at Caesar's Buffet. However the deserts were much better in the 80's.,5,5,5,5,November 8 2024
Best on the strip! Wonderful food and service! You get what you pay for.,5,5,5,5,November 8 2024
Lobster Claws were treacherous. Terrible fishy flavor. Tasted nothing like good lobster. Online advertisement mentioned a lot that is yet to be seen. Very unsatisfied for the Two hundred dollar dinner for two....,2,1,3,3,November 8 2024
1st time visit. Have had much better  Pros: impressed with multiple stations: Filipino station with lechon pork 5. spinach salad 5. Nutella banana crepe 5. Knew not to consume any rice. potato or bread.  Cons: frozen deep fried foods (wing zings and fried calamari). Beef brisket. absolutely no flavor. Birria ramen broth. was way too salty. Thank goodness I had a $100 coupon + points to only pay a balance of $6 for 2 ppl + $50 tip.  Wynn buffet is much better.,3,3,5,4,November 8 2024
It’s an experience. Food was plentiful and good. Wide selection.,4,4,3,3,November 8 2024
Great time with good food. We loved the Asian dishes and the seafood. Staff were nice and efficient. Wait time was not bad even with reservation.,5,5,5,5,November 8 2024
Good selection but some of the food had been there for a while and was gold or dry. Not worth the price on my opinion.,4,4,4,4,November 8 2024
When they sit u down and they say u have 90 minutes to eat instead of good evening or thank you for coming. Or what can we get to drink that tells you why the bacchanal is going downhill.  Use to be a great buffet,3,3,1,2,November 8 2024
Es toda un experiencia. Es un valor alto por persona. más si eres light para comer. Pero si eres de buen comer como yo. lo disfrutas al 100%.,5,5,5,4,November 7 2024
The breakfast was amazing.  Very quiet for a Thursday morning.  Service excellent.,5,5,5,5,November 7 2024
They didn’t even put us in a table nor let us in the restaurant while on the waiting list,1,3,1,5,November 7 2024
Very disappointing. Standing in line in the oriental area. The gentlemen in front was eating off of his plate…that’s totally ok. BUT the idiot licks his fingers and touches the steamer cover and service utensils with the same gross licked fingers! It was disgusting. I did NOT stay in line to finish getting shumais or pork buns! FAAHHHH all the money we spent. that’s pretty much all I eat! DANG DISAPPOINTING!,3,4,5,3,November 7 2024
Don’t bother. What a rip. Don’t waste your time!!!,1,1,5,2,November 7 2024
Been here many times and had enjoyed this buffet all the previous times. But this time. it was a horrible experience. and this is going to be my last time in a while coming back.  Made reservation with OpenTable for 7:30 and we didn’t get seated until 8:20. When in line. they did not allow us to pay with the kiosk. One couple behind us did it anyways. Then when we get to the front of the register. we are told to use the kiosk. and once we paid we can get back in line to be seated. And of course the couple who paid get to be ahead of the 3 parties that needed to use the kiosk to pay. How is this fair?!  Then the 3 women (especially the Armenian looking one) who take us to the table has preference to seat large parties. Had 4 large groups of people (even the 1 party that just got in the standby line while they were seating the 3rd group got seated first before us). So the other 2 women were just standing around completely oblivious that we have been waiting for a while. Fine. it is SEMA week and I understand it’s packed. However. when seated I noticed there were at least 20 empty tables. I am not sure if these women are just lazy or just don’t feel like working.  Ordered our drinks. One drink was brought out incorrectly. Told our server about it and she finally brought it after 15 mins. She mentioned that she forgot about it. Before. servers would come and ask how we are doing and if we need anything every 15 minutes. So far as I am still sitting at the buffet for 40 minutes. not once did our server came to check on us.  Food- the only thing that is good is the Pepsi. All seafood were bad. Crabs and lobster claws have no flavor at all. Dungeness crab was spoiled and I immediately spit it out. Pozole was overly salty. elote was bland. roasted duck is dry. prime rib has no flavor. With buffet at this price point. I have higher expectation of the quality of food.  $105 per person was money wasted.,1,1,1,1,November 7 2024
So much food. all well prepared. something for everyone. The line to check-in with a reservation was confusing but after that all was good. Our server was excellent. very helpful. Well worth the price.,5,5,5,5,November 7 2024
great dinning experience. many quality options. go early come hungry.,5,5,5,5,November 7 2024
Great selection.  Too much movement so staff unable to keep floors clean where rude customers have dropped food.  Just about everything was good except Brisket which tasted rancid so I advised waitress to let kitchen know but not sure message got across. Definitely worth the price for the wide selection.,4,4,4,3,November 7 2024
Great food.ambiance I visited 28th of July was wonderful I went 6th of November 2024 everything was great again except üne drink got more sweeter and little strange that’s all  I highly recommend this place. Prime rib was so good and also crabs.sweets as always It’s a journey,4,4,5,4,November 7 2024
Nicole was great. She was very helpful checked on us all the time. ￼,5,5,5,5,November 6 2024
The prime rib was cold. The brisket was very dry and cold. The taco station. all tacos. were cold as well. This was such a disappointment. especially after paying $185. For 2 people. Will never come back,1,1,4,5,November 6 2024
We went there last year and we had a great time so we went back for my birthday and we were looking forward to have lamb chops but we were disappointed to find out that they didn't have it anymore I think the price of the buffet is too high for what you get.,4,4,3,3,November 6 2024
Lack of foods variety. old decor no big deal. old table. not enough waiters. and finally $170 plus tax and tips for 2 persons. seems little excessive what what is available.,2,3,3,2,November 5 2024
Was really looking forward to our evening. we knew it was pricey but that’s Vegas for you so was hoping for great expectations. Unfortunately the food was cold. We are a family of 4 and everyone of us said the same thing. It wasn’t just one particular food station but all of them. Very disappointed with this.,2,1,5,3,November 5 2024
Lots of food but most of the food was Cold and Dry Not Worth The Money!,3,2,5,2,November 5 2024
"715 reservation but waiting line ""after check in""  for 50 mins till seated. Crab legs were always cold and the rest of the seafood was salad type served cold. No steamers. seafood imperial. little necks nothing. Was disappointed especially for the price!!!",2,2,4,3,November 5 2024
Very busy was not explained the different areas very well,4,4,5,3,November 5 2024
All was satisfactory exception of dessert section. I was disappointed what was available. I felt need improvement.,4,4,4,4,November 5 2024
It was not clean and good. Food was worse than I expected. I wouldn't like to recommend this buffet to any person.,3,2,3,2,November 5 2024
This is one of the premier buffets left in Vegas. The place is always immaculate and the food is cooked to perfection. I eat here every time I’m in Vegas and hope they continue to provide this great service.,5,5,5,5,November 4 2024
We have done a lot of research about which buffet to try before we went to Vegas. and ended up choosing Bacchanal Buffet over Wynn Buffet.  The price is reasonable at USD 70 each.  They have a lot of food choices and 9 sections of food counters.  However there are not that many food that is worth trying.  The Japanese and Chinese food is basically a write off.  Mexican is not very attractive either.  Desert has a lot of selections. but the taste and the look are a bit overrated by other reviews.  The only food that I enjoyed was the slow cooked brisket. which is very well seasoned and tender.  As my wife loves eating crabs. the king crab seems to be the only dish that she likes.  The overall experience is not bad. but I wish I have reserved our stomachs for better food.,2,3,1,1,November 4 2024
Celebrate my father's 82nd birthday.  He enjoyed the whole experience with family  and friends,5,5,5,5,November 4 2024
We really enjoyed the variety of foods. Great tasting shrimp and brisket. Missed the carnita tacos from past visits.,5,5,5,5,November 4 2024
Best buffet on in Las Vegas! Huge variety of great food!,5,5,5,5,November 4 2024
Awesome buffet! The crab legs were wonderful! Only wish you would add lobster! And also claim chowder!,4,5,5,5,November 4 2024
Muy bien el servicio solo que la host de la entrada algo especial,5,5,5,4,November 4 2024
All cuts if meat melt in your mouth . Table service for clearing plates was fast and crab legs were amazing,5,5,5,5,November 3 2024
This buffet was not as good as it used to be and for what they charge I think the food should taste better. There were a lot of food items that were disappointing. Prime rib was average. the horseradish sauce was not as good as it should be. Some dimsum in the Asian section were dry. Bone marrow was also just average in terms of taste. The Italian section was a huge disappointment. pizzas were dry and not enough flavor and the taste of pasta was also just average. Some of the seats were ripped which made it looked cheap. For $90 per person. I expected better. I’ve had this buffet in 2018 and it was a better experience then,3,3,4,3,November 3 2024
Food is excellent and server was great. Just a little noisy.,5,5,5,5,November 3 2024
Everything was decent quality. The desert was amazing but never had much room left in my stomach.,3,3,4,4,November 3 2024
"While not a huge fan of buffets. we needed a spot for dinner before a concert at Ceasar's. and the buffet was the only time slot available.  When we stepped up to check in and pay I was taken back by the cost - almost $100/person on a Saturday night.  I am fine paying higher prices on vacation. but I thought ""this place better impress"" -well it CERTAINLY DID!    The first buffet we passed was FULL OF GORGEOUS SEAFOOD!  Snow crab legs. shrimp. snails. mussels -you name it!  My friend and I both adore seafood. but she also loves prime rib and the carving station was the next thing we walked by as we were being seated- spectacular meats.  We were then led past the most massive dessert buffet with anything you could possibly imagine from macrons to baby cheesecakes and other bite sized delights to an ice cream bar.  We couldn't wait to sit down.    The dining room is massive which does cause the noise levels to be a bit overwhelming at times and there were  a lot of groups there-especially ones with children so not the ""ambiance"" you may be looking for a romantic meal.  Once we were seated we were also pointed to a whole other room which had Italian (meatballs comparable to my grandfathers and delicious creative pizza options). Asian. and vegetarian selections.  I never had anything as delicious as the individual mini plates of things like whipped burrata with pears on top. or a baby bite of salmon with cream freche and capers.  The plating and presentation was on par with some of my favorite high-end foodie cruises.    We sat for almost 2 hours slowly enjoying much more food than we could have gotten anywhere for the price we paid. our server was attentive at all times on it with drinks and clearing used plates.  For as huge a dining room as it was. you never felt like you had to wait for your food or were in terribly long lines.    AMAZING VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR!  ENJOY THIS BUFFET WHEN IN VEGAS!!",5,5,5,4,November 3 2024
The food was soon good :) we had a blast. the seafood was great and prime ribs and briskets were delicious. The wait wasn’t bad at all. about 15-20 mins,5,5,5,5,November 2 2024
Easily one of the best buffets in Vegas. I would say second to Wynn. I came here to eat breakfast. around 10am. and ended up eating Mexican all the way lol. I saw nothing American breakfast. Bits of eggs here and there. There was more sushi/asian food than anything else. I get it. but some of us enjoy a good old American breakfast. Service was amazing. absolutely hands down. Will definitely be back. just not for breakfast! lol.,5,4,5,5,November 2 2024
While there is a wide selection of food. this might be the most overrated buffet in Vegas. Made reservations for a party of 5 and when we got to our table in the back it was dirty. Crumbs and food all over one of the chairs and watermelon chunks all over the floor. We couldn’t get any help so we had to grab a chair from another table and carefully avoid the food on the floor beneath our table. Our server. whose only job was to bring us water and some soda as we didn’t order alcohol- couldn’t remember who had which soda and was non-existent after bringing us drinks even though we were all forced to tip for service before we even entered the buffet (where you serve yourself! No one is even taking your order!). Half the food was cold and the sliders so rare that I am pretty sure the cow may have still been alive. The ambience was loud and our table and chairs were so knicked up and splintering they appeared as if you got them from a yard sale. As this was one of the more expensive buffets. I expected much more. Good place to go if you have kids I suppose but you are much better off visiting the buffets at The Wynn. bellagio. Cosmo. etc. The service. ambience and food are much better at the others- and their buffets are much easier to find.,2,2,2,2,November 2 2024
I had very bad experience this time I went two years ago was very good but now they have old food and very few options Asian Italian options are worthless the service is very bad. I would not recommend it in 2024.,1,1,1,1,November 2 2024
it was well worth the price. We didn't have to wait for too long,5,5,5,5,November 2 2024
Great selection of food.  Prime rib and seafood section always a highlight.  Finish off with macaroons. scooped ice cream and large desserts to choose from.  Always make a point to make reservations online BEFORE planning Vegas vacation.,4,4,5,4,November 2 2024
Having a reservation didn’t mean anything. We got in a line with everyone who had no reservation. We waited for 30 minutes past the reservation time to be seated. The place was a mad house. It was difficult to get into the correct line to get the food you wanted. People were rude. However. the food was good.,4,5,4,2,November 2 2024
Way overpriced. and a terrible value for the money. Will not do again. Seafood was mediocre and just thrown out there. All cold. no seafood dishes. lobster claws were cold and unappealing. No scallops. no lobster tails. no fish dishes. just poorly done.,3,2,3,2,November 1 2024
Muy Delicioso y la comida fue de todo. la atención muy buena !!!!,5,5,5,5,November 1 2024
One of a kind experience! IMO the best buffet in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,November 1 2024
Food never ran out. lots of options. our waitress was fantastic. food tasted good. noise was tolerable. crowds were manageable. good amount of condiments to choose from. No complaints. will definitely return.,5,5,5,5,November 1 2024
Great place to eat all that you can! They give you 1hr & 30 minutes to eat & most of the food is good,5,5,5,5,November 1 2024
This was probably the worst buffet I’ve been to. I haven’t been to a buffet for years and coming back to this kind of quality and service was just terrible. Not sure how long the sushi or meat was out for but my stomach was definitely off after those selections. We only had a few plates and just couldn’t finish our meals feel satisfied.,1,1,1,1,November 1 2024
Omg I loved it my waiter was perfect!!! The food was amazing! I will be coming back every time I come to Vegas! This was the best buffet place I have ever eaten at gourmet buffet I wish I was there right now so worth the money! And the 90 minute you have plenty of time to eat plenty don’t listen to the bad reviews I almost did but I’m glad I came to see for myself I can’t wait to go back!!!,5,5,5,5,November 1 2024
This buffet was great. Lots of tasty options and delicious selections. The omelet station was hard to find. Great Atmosphere with friendly helpful staff.,5,5,5,4,November 1 2024
We visited twice once on Oct 29th which was OUTSTANDING!! And also the reason we made a second reservation for Oct 31st. The visit on Oct 31st wasn’t even close to the previous visit. I mainly visited for the seafood because I am pescatarian. However the crab legs that I so enjoyed the previous visit were kinda bad. They were ice cold and not fresh like my previous visit. It was like they came straight out of the fridge so I really didn’t enjoy them. I felt like I wasted my Money the second visit. My mother complained about the same thing as well. Also it was like a lot of the people thee dishes had set for a very long time. Maybe because you weren’t as busy on Halloween as you were the previous time. I really wasn’t happy wit my food this time around. But great experience nonetheless.,4,2,5,5,November 1 2024
Lots of variety. Excellent value. Good service. Food quality can be a little better.,5,4,5,5,November 1 2024
This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. This place is a scam and not worth $436 we paid for 4 to eat at the buffet. I am not sure how's its even possible for the food to taste as bad as did. By far the lowest quality of food at a restaurant I have been to that I had to make an open table reservation for. We tried almost all the food and 98% was inedible. Please do not waste your hard earned money here. We spent at least $300 every evening eating at some wonderful restaurants at the Venetian. This place is over priced for garbage quality. A meal at a fast food restaurant would have been better and more satisfying.  Stay away and don't be fooled.,1,1,3,3,November 1 2024
Overall service and food was good. except for seafood section. Upon walking in my husband and I noted an off-putting smell. I chose not to have any of the seafood and was glad I did. My husband indulged and he was sure some of the items had been frozen and not fresh. The snails were uneatable. the lobster in shell overcooked. The Asian section was excellent. as was the meat. pizza and salad bar. And a nice offering of cheeses. Desserts were excellent as well. Giving a 3 overall since when you pay $80/per person you expect to be able to enjoy the seafood (at that price point). My husband had stomach issues for 24 hours following us eating there.,3,3,4,4,October 31 2024
Everything we tried was delicious. A huge variety of everything.,5,5,5,5,October 31 2024
Buffet was good. I thought the sushi choices would have been better. Wasn’t happy with that especially since the pictures showed some really good sushi. It didn’t have any of that.  Very disappointed,3,3,5,5,October 31 2024
Nothing was good unfortunately.  Not even provided with proper tools for crab.,1,1,1,1,October 31 2024
The meat coner is one of the worst I ever tasted.  Most are well done and dried up although you ordered medium rare and the prime rib is also subpar.,3,3,3,3,October 31 2024
Very great seafood and long queue even we made the reservation. But they won’t kick u out even after 90 min time up at late night and good variety is great,5,5,3,2,October 31 2024
I was very excited to try this buffet. but it didn’t quite meet expectations. The crab legs and lobster claws were good. but I was surprised to find that everything else in the seafood area was cold. I tried the mussels for example and it was just strange eating them cold. The prawn was sweet and tasty but again. cold. Overall the rest of the food was decent but not very warm. so by the time you found your table again. you were eating cold food. Some food like the potato salad was undercooked and some of the meat was overcooked. Dessert was honestly the best part. Of all you want are crab legs and lobster claws. go for it. If you want other food. I’d go to a regular sit-down restaurant. There were numerous of them in the hotel worth considering.,3,3,5,3,October 31 2024
For the price. the food was ok and the service was terrible,1,2,1,1,October 31 2024
Too pricey for the buffet . Even though the food is delicious. the lobster were not too soft.,5,5,5,4,October 31 2024
Always a delicious buffet with a crazy amount of choices. Always a must when going to Vegas!,5,5,5,5,October 30 2024
Lining up for 30mins when you have a reservation is not good…. They can streamline this if someone cared,5,5,2,5,October 30 2024
The hype for this place was crazy compared to the food.  It was just average.  Could have spent 186.00 for a better meal somewhere else.,3,3,4,5,October 30 2024
Beautiful Clean and delicious . this is not talked about as much as it should be. You won't be disappointed.,5,5,5,5,October 30 2024
I guessed the price mostly want to the seafood.  But my husband and I are persons who won't consume lots of seafood just because it's expensive. And according to my husband. the seafood was not very fresh. What attracted me to a buffet is the chance to try cuisines in different countries. and Bacchanal Buffet satisfied that expectation to some degree. but not impressively. Overall it's an OK experience. but I don't it worth the price.,3,3,5,4,October 30 2024
Always a great place that is why we always return,5,5,5,5,October 30 2024
Very overrated and nothing like I expected the food to be. I have heard this is the best buffet on the strip. but the food wasn’t even ‘just fine’. or even passable. it was actively BAD,1,1,4,3,October 30 2024
Loved it. A great value for the money. So many options to choose form.,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
Used to be my favorite place to eat in Vegas but the manager was completely unprofessional and rude.,1,1,1,1,October 29 2024
We visited the buffet with our 7 year old daughter from the UK and we had the best time ever! We have never been to an outstanding buffet like this and we have travelled a lot. Roger our server was fantastic and kept our drinks topped up. The quality and presentation of the food was fantastic. we will definitely go again when we come to Vegas!,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
It wasn't as good as last time we were there The shrimp was tasteless other food so so If you've never been there give it try Better bring extra money it's not cheap,3,3,2,4,October 29 2024
Not worth the price. Prime rib was cold. Felt rushed with only 90 minutes. U spend most of your time waiting in line to get food or make the rounds to see what’s available. Then u have to rush to finish in your time limit.,3,3,4,3,October 29 2024
Everything was simply AMAZING‼️🥰 I would recommend to EVERYONE,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
I first went to the buffet as a solo traveler in 2014. Returning 10 years later with my travel club was such a highlight. It's well worth the price. especially considering how much you would pay for a typical lunch or dinner in Vegas. We dined on a Monday. which was the Crab buffet. YUM!,5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
they had welks. saffron lobster and my favorite. Crabs!!!,5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
We were put on the waitlist and that moved fairly quickly. The staff and service was good and pleasant. but the food was subpar. Food that was supposed to be hot was cold for the price quality was low and underwhelming I would have rather gone somewhere else. ￼,1,1,4,2,October 28 2024
The food was mediocre and at a low level. Very sweet or too salty. Many dishes were inedible. The price per person was way too high for this service. Also that you can stay for a maximum of 90 minutes is unbelievable at a brunch for 90 dollars per person. You also get only once cutlery for different dishes and also only filter coffee. It's under the grain!,1,1,1,1,October 28 2024
Server very helpful and friendly.  The buffet is laid out weird. very confusing,2,2,4,2,October 28 2024
The queue to be seated was huge. when we were seated we had to ask 3 times if we could order some drinks. Food was good but not amazing.,2,4,1,2,October 28 2024
we dined in for my mom's birthday and it was amazing! food was good. service was good. everything was good! thank you sue for amazing service :),5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
We ate dinner at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace on a Sunday evening. The food is outstanding! There are so many different food stations. and everything was super fresh and tasty. Given that this is a Caesars property. I was surprised that there wasn’t an Italian station. but there were certainly enough other choices.  All in all. the food and service were fantastic. My only negative is the price.  The weekend dinner price per person is $87.99–quite steep for any kind 9f buffet. It’s a wonderful place to try for a once-in-a-while dining experience. or special occasion. but it’s not somewhere I could afford to go very frequently. Be sure to book a reservation in advance. as I don’t think they accept walk-ins. at least not on weekends.,4,5,5,5,October 27 2024
As a big eater and frequenter of buffets and AYCE restaurants. I had this buffet planned as my final amazing culinary stop on our Las Vegas trip.  Google said this was the top buffet in Vegas.  I have never been so disappointed in my life.  Neither myself nor my girlfriend found one thing that was worth having seconds of.  Everything was over salted and I like salt.  Dishes like Korean BBQ that should be impossible to mess up. were barely edible.  I've been to the casino buffets in Atlantic city. including Caesars. and this one in Vegas fell so far short. I've honestly been to an $8 lunch buffet that was more satisfying than the Bacchanal in Vegas.  They couldn't pay us $200 to eat that meal again.  I guess they rely on the endless lobster to draw people in but the lobster is served two ways.   Either cold to be dipped in warm butter or warm and pre-seasoned and very dried out.  Desserts were tasty. but nothing particularly special about them and you don't judge the quality of your meal by the dessert.  I'm also one of those people who won't leave anything on my plate.   I tasted probably 25 different things.   I finished maybe 5 or 6.  The rest were just so dissatisfying that I took a bite or two and moved on to the next disappointment.  Go to a food truck or literally anywhere else.  Southwest Diner in Boulder City was our first stop.  Absolutely delicious beef quesadillas and everything else we had there was on point.,1,1,4,2,October 27 2024
I always enjoy Bacchanal.  The service continues to be great.  The only observation I have is the pricing.  It seems like it changes every visit.,5,5,5,5,October 27 2024
The Brazilian station is the best of them all.  The creamy mashed potatoes are FIRE!  The seafood station was disappointing.  The prawns tasted funny and the lobster claws were underwhelming.  There is a hour-and-a-half limit -- plenty of time to feast.  Would I do it again?  Probably not because I don't want diabetes. but my one-time experience was great.,4,5,4,3,October 27 2024
Family next to us had videos on full blast playing throughout their meal. Kept taking phone calls on speaker as if they owned the place. None of the staff attempted to stop their obnoxious behavior. Not to mention. the way they were eating was a bit unsavory.,4,4,5,3,October 27 2024
The seafood waste like it has been in the freezer too long.  The food overall not really worth the price.,2,3,2,3,October 27 2024
Service was bad  food was good nice ambiance I shouldn’t tip at the register before eating,3,3,1,3,October 26 2024
Food was good. we were able to sit on time. server was friendly and very accomodating,5,5,5,5,October 26 2024
Great selection of dishes. worth the price! Highly recommended,5,5,5,5,October 26 2024
This isn’t the experience I was hoping for and the value for what I paid was disappointing.,2,2,4,2,October 26 2024
We had a great time. except our Vegan daughter wished there were tofu choices.  There was not one vegan protein offered — and she is used to that — but for a buffet that size to not have 1 tofu plate was a little discouraging.  Our server was amazing!  We would definitely go back!,4,5,5,5,October 26 2024
It was crowded but we got breakfast and went right for crab legs after! Had 90 minutes to eat was enough time to dine! Loved it.,5,5,5,5,October 26 2024
Food quality and selection has declined since it first opened. Price is not proportional to the selection,3,3,4,3,October 26 2024
Bacchanal is hands down the best brunch buffet that I have experienced in Las Vegas.  The size. the selections. and the food are superb!!!!  I am a very picky eater and enjoyed every item that I tried. I highly recommended and will try the dinner buffet on my next visit.,5,5,5,5,October 26 2024
The buffet was a great way to start our day in Vegas!  The food was fresh with plenty of variety. The head chef was super accommodating to special requests. Don't miss the sweet woman Sarah who was on the crepe station. My Bananas Foster's crepe with caramel sauce. nuts and whipped cream might have been the best thing I had all day!  And. if you ask. Sarah might also tell you the secret to making the perfect crepe at home!!  Delicious!!,5,5,5,5,October 26 2024
If you like quantity it’s great. We went mainly for the shellfish and were disappointed. Lobster was cold and tasteless. Snow crab was also cold but at least it tasted halfway decent. For $100+ per person you can get a better dinner somewhere else.,4,3,5,4,October 26 2024
My experience is absolutely wonderful. splendid splendid splendid. I highly recommend this to others who come to visit. The food was spectacular. Your team was the best and you guys just keep up this work and although I live way on the East Coast. I would travel that far to do it all over again Thank you Caesars bacchanal,5,5,4,5,October 26 2024
It is really only worth it if you stick with the prime rib (which was actually really good) and the seafood. Desserts. ube horchata. and the Thai were delicious.,4,3,5,4,October 26 2024
I was so hoping this buffet would be the best.  Although quite expensive. it wasn’t worth it.  My family and I have been all over the world and have eaten at many buffets and this was the worst.  Seafood was cold and inedible. the meats were overcooked and barely edible. they ran out of fresh fruit (watermelon) there was nothing acceptable for our 14 year old to eat and the list goes on.  We will not return!,2,1,3,3,October 26 2024
It was not worth the money and it really wasn't that tasty. Will never go back. Red Lobster is much better,1,1,3,1,October 26 2024
Over priced. the food was great. Seafood station wasn’t the best. Overall 7/10,4,4,4,3,October 25 2024
Bad. Not worth the $$$. Food quality is good…. But not worth the money.,3,3,2,2,October 25 2024
Not worth $90 a person. Lots of variety but everything was SO salty.,3,3,4,4,October 25 2024
Its very crowded & its noisy.There are plenty of foods to choose and its delicious. Price its too high given that u cant eat all of it. We are late 1 hr of our reservation but still they hold on to it. staff are friendly as well. Food refills are always on time.. The main reason we went to is just to eat Crab legs and prime rib its delicious moist .. I would recommend this buffet if u prefer to eat king crabs although its extremely pricey for 89$ per person,5,5,5,3,October 25 2024
Food was bland.  If you don’t like the smell of raw fish. don’t even walk in. There was a hair in my tri tip and when I told my server . all she said was that she’d tell the cooks about it. Didn’t apologize nor offer a partial refund. They didn’t have much that sounded appetizing. I enjoyed the refreshments though .,2,1,1,4,October 25 2024
Lobster claws waterlogged and overcooked. Shrimps overcooked and texture was like paste. Sushi not prepared properly. Duck was greasy and overcooked. Pastries were dry and flavorless.  Expensive ingredients were poorly prepared. Expensive mediocre cafeteria!!!,2,1,4,4,October 25 2024
It’s good. but maybe our expectations were too high. I expected to be blown away,3,3,3,2,October 25 2024
Wow! What a great selection of items. from seafood to Prime Rib to BBQ.  They even had an Asian soup noddle section for Pho!  Will definitely be back!,5,5,5,5,October 25 2024
Overpriced for menu selections. Mediocre food and quality.,3,2,4,4,October 25 2024
The food was cold at a lot of stations but the prime rib was delicious .,3,3,1,3,October 25 2024
I’m glad I did it but I wouldn’t do it again.   Food was good and we ate a lot but it wasn’t anything outstanding.  The gourmet butter slaps.  The Birria tacos are a must.,4,3,5,3,October 25 2024
The Bacchanal Buffet is renowned for its extensive selection and high-quality dishes. making it a top dining destination. If you had a great experience. it’s worth highlighting how the variety and flavors stood out. Shout out to Ms Brenda. it sounds like she provided exceptional service! You could commend her for her attentiveness and ability to enhance your overall dining experience. It’s always great to recognize outstanding staff members!,5,5,5,5,October 25 2024
The lobster claw has no flavor at all. It feels like rubber and really dry. The tables are too close to each other.,3,2,3,4,October 25 2024
I was extremely dissatisfied. I wanted to eat at the Bacchanal Buffet for the seafood experience.  While there were plenty of choices. I thought the food had very little to no flavor. The servers behind the food stations were friendly and most helpful.  The wait staff was ok.   Since this was supposed to be one of the highlights of my trip. I was extremely sorry to have spent that much money and walk away so dissatisfied . I do not mind spending that much money if the quality of food is good.   I certainly did not need the 90 minute time restriction😢,1,1,3,2,October 24 2024
My plan was to have crab legs. the cold crab legs had no taste. The heated crab legs were great. Stay away from the lobster claws. they where old dry and tough.,3,3,5,5,October 24 2024
Crab legs were disappointing.  They’ve always been very good and huge.  Not this time.,3,4,5,4,October 24 2024
everything was great. thank you for an amazing experience,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
Solid as Always. There is no Better buffet in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
Food is always warm. fresh and excellent. This is the only buffet I visit on every trip and I’ve been to a few.,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
Incredible food!! It was my husband and I's first time in Vegas and our first buffet there and it was fantastic! The food. the vibe and UBE HORCHATA - delicious!! Thank you so much!,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
$90 for a wide variety of mostly bland and flavorless food of which you have 90 minutes to eat.,2,1,4,4,October 24 2024
The lobster claws were chewy and dry. The crab legs were still frozen. The oyster Rockefeller was cold. The scallops had a strange sauce on them that didn’t complement the scallops. The deserts were tasteless. The Prime Rib. Mac and cheese and tacos were the only good food there that I tried.,2,1,3,2,October 24 2024
Grab a little of everything. it sounds weird. but everything is delicious.,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
Not worth the amount they charge. Better options in Vegas than this subpar dining option,2,2,3,3,October 24 2024
The food was good. I think with the options that were given it all could have been hotter. I think it would have been 5star if the food was hot. it was just lukewarm.,4,4,3,4,October 24 2024
I had my birthday dinner there. There was such a variety of food. The large crab legs. scallops and oysters ￼were great. Beef lovers would have enjoyed the beef sirloin ￼. There was Italian and Asian foods as well. The mini desserts were great. The staff was very attentive and the atmosphere was nice. Some people think that it’s expensive . but when you look at all that’s offered to eat . it is very much worth it,5,5,5,4,October 23 2024
The best buffet me and my husband went to we live buffets and we surely will be back. My husband loved everything in the buffet. We highly recommend Bacchanal Buffet located in Caesars Palace Casino. You surely will injoy every bite.,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
The customer service was excellent and we were seated fairly quickly. Food was outstanding with a huge selection of different cultures of food that we were able to try. I highly recommend this place for buffet.,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
The service was great and the food was delicious .,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
"We had an OK experience with the buffet.   First of all. the hostess named PATY who took us to our table was very rude and unprofessional. impolite and unfriendly. She did not greet  or welcome us or ask whether if it was our first time to this buffet. She just asked us to follow her around then to a table for TWO people. but we were a party of 8. We looked at the table and said we are a party of 8. then she said this table is for a party in front of us whom we DID NOT not see at all. She raised her voice and said ""calm down"" and gave us a very rude facial expression and took us around the dining area again then finally to our table. Then she just walked away. It was a very unpleasant welcome to such a well-known buffet in Las Vegas.  Secondly. there were  A LOT of food from seafood. beef. Chinese. Japanese. Italian. Korean. Filipino. Vietnamese and etc...  but they were not GREAT and WARM enough. Snow crab legs were watery and lobster claws were not flavorful. The prime ribs were dry and looked raw to us. The Asian cuisine was not authentic and plain. Tom Yum soup did not taste like Tom Yum. We were disappointed with the food quality.   Thirdly. the desserts were GREAT! They had a crepe station. ice cream station. macarons and it was impressive. The fruits choice was very limited though.   I would say this buffet is a one-time experience only and we would never come back again.",3,3,3,4,October 23 2024
The food was below average. Was expecting more for the price point.,1,1,2,2,October 23 2024
Making a reservation didn't matter. I booked online and it asked for which occession and I noted as a birthday but there was nothing special.  It was pricy ($89 +tip of course)  but the food was great. so many choices and taste good. Luckily we went early otherwise there's a long queue in every stations. The one and only annoyed me was I got asked from tip even before using their service and I got the sarcastic look when I refused but wanted to do that after the service.  I would say this buffet is a one-time experience only and if we want to come back again? No. we would never come back again.,3,4,2,2,October 23 2024
Pricey for a buffet but there’s plenty of options to choose from.,4,4,4,4,October 23 2024
Robster and sea foods were good. Otherwise. overall quality was not that good considering the price.,4,3,3,4,October 22 2024
Greatest buffet I’ve ever had. absolutely amazing,5,5,5,5,October 22 2024
The egg tarts were awesome!!!! The seafood was not cracked enough to get out of shell without a LOT of work!,4,4,5,4,October 22 2024
Este lugar tiene muy buen ambiente. atención amable y la comida deliciosa.,5,5,5,5,October 22 2024
I had a metal piece in the food which I luckily found it immediately. Apart from that everything else is really good service. ambience. sea food. But I wouldn’t accept the 100$ buffet can have such metal pieces it has to be checked properly before placing in the buffet station.,2,1,5,5,October 22 2024
Our group decided to give the Bacchanal Buffet a chance due to its similar reviews online as the Wynn Buffet ( ie. YouTube / web reviews) and overall we were really disappointed with the quality of food. The wait staff were great and always made sure our drinks were topped up. The food on the other hand was sub-par for a buffet costing $100usd ( including tax and tips). We went on a Monday at 6pm. so we expected the food to be fresh and not any leftovers at that time.  -The lobster claws were over cooked. The cold shrimp was not fresh. There were no raw oysters or even any sashimi at their Japanese food station.  -The quality of their Asian food was below your regular food court level. Their kalbi ribs were all fat and bones.  dim sum were frozen store brought level and their japchae was soggy. Their sushi was also similar to what you get at Costco.  Items that were really good included their prime rib / taco station and dessert selections.  I would not even pay $50 for this Buffet. I have been to the Wynn Buffet and the quality of food and selection was alot better. It was frustrating because we were deciding between the Wynn or the Bacchanal. We felt like we just lost in a game of buffet baccarat. I rather see less items and a shift to providing better food quality and preparation. I don't mind spending $100 per person on a buffet . but Ceasars need to try harder to delivery a better buffet than what they are charging.,3,2,4,4,October 22 2024
Way too expensive and the food not really good and service not good either!!!!,2,2,1,2,October 22 2024
the cold seafood is not good. The lobster was bland. Other than that. everything else taste good.,5,3,4,5,October 21 2024
the cost effective is too bad compared to the guide,1,2,3,3,October 21 2024
Great staff and a large array of options to choose from. For the most part. the food was still of a buffet quality but there are so many options everyone is bound to find something to eat. even the pickiest eaters. The best stand outs when we went were: pozole. birria anything. both poke options. and the mac & cheese. Plus the creme brulee. egg tarts and gelatos were good. The only item I would not try again was the lobster benedict which was too fishy and gave me more canned tuna than lobster. All the other seafood was solid.,4,4,5,4,October 21 2024
Food was bland  the price with tax was over priced  at 200 for 2 people plus 50 for alcohol drinks the service  and wait was slow and unfriendly and i had a reservation! The lobster was so overcooked mushy watery and tasted terrible!! The only food  that was good was the ice cream and the meatballs everything else was horrible! I know good food and i know tasteless food and this places food was not good at all.Our waitress was slow old and never came but  the one time for refills on the drinks.I spoke to 2 managers who were non chalant about the complaints on the service and overcooked lobster. Never coming back!!!! Booked a flight and hotel stay just to come to this overpriced Buffet to only stay 30 mins.They give you 90 mins but it was so bad we left after a 1/2 an hr I will never ever everrrr return! We went to the Wynn Buffet!Itwas 10 times better!!! Dont waste your money go to Wynn Hotel Buffet you will be happy you did!,1,1,1,1,October 21 2024
The cashier was very rude and it was way to expensive. I wasvery disapointed with the food. I would not recomend Bacchanal Buffet to friends or family. I am very disapointe.d with the price and the way the Cashier spoke to me,2,2,3,2,October 21 2024
It was absolutely the worst buffet I have ever been to.,1,1,1,1,October 21 2024
Really great but making a reservation did not matter. we still had to wait in line with people who were just walking in with no reservation. Wait was not too long and it was still a good experience overall.,5,5,5,5,October 21 2024
Outstanding. great choices and wonderful service from Hilaria!!,5,5,5,5,October 21 2024
The food was cold. For around $90 a person. that’s sorta ridiculous. The food throughout the buffet was consistently cold/room temperature. We saw our server once when we first sat down. then didn’t see them again for about 45 minutes. The service and food quality is consistent with a $30-$40 buffet. Way overpriced. The best part was the dessert. which was pretty good.,2,2,1,3,October 21 2024
Worth the money! 90m goes way faster than I expected with crab legs,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
Whole experience was excellent. Selection of what was on offer was amazing,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
Good experience.  Definitely make a reservation beforehand.  Weekend seafood was plentiful and delish!  Get the prime rib.  The other food was just okay.,4,4,5,5,October 20 2024
Paying $200 and only having 90 minutes to eat is a scam. I was told that I had to get up and leave even though I wasn’t done with my food. What kind of restaurant does this to a paying customer I like to savor and enjoy my food. I can’t just start scarfing  a bunch of food down to meet the 90 minute limit that you set.￼  Also what is it with requiring a tip before you even get service? What if you get bad service how do you change your tip then?,2,2,3,3,October 20 2024
Brunch on Sunday morning is a 10/10!! I would recommend it to everyone going to Vegas. We went at 11am and the buffet wasn’t super busy. Crab legs for days and left the place rolling,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
The best Buffet ever. We come to Vegas 1 time a year & I make my reservations months in advance so I don't miss it.,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
Great experience food was delicious. Dessert bar was exceptional. carving station on point,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
So this was the first time we had gone to Bacchanal. The experience was great. The food was good and the servers in the kitchen were amazing. The only downfall was I know we could have been seated a lot quicker but there was so many dirty tables that weren’t being cleaned.Our reservation was at 9:30pm and we didn’t end up being seated till almost 9:50. All in all we had a good time.,4,5,3,5,October 20 2024
This is HANDS DOWN the best buffet in Vegas. There are so many quality options that you may want to eat there every night. I go to Vegas just to go to Bacchanal. You will not be disappointed. BEST FOOD IN VEGAS!!!,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
Bacchanal Buffet has a great selection of seafood and international foods. Hundreds of items to select from makes it a go to dining location at Caesars!  The food is hot and fresh. never old dried out stuff.,5,5,4,5,October 20 2024
Some of the food-Mexican wasn’t seasoned very well. Crab was not good at all and that is what we came For not much flavor,5,3,5,3,October 20 2024
It was great! One of the assistant managers saved it from being a terrible experience. Thank you John!,5,5,3,5,October 20 2024
The food. except for the asian food. pretty much was tasteless.  For the price you can do much better.  Caesar's doesn't care too much about the customer.  It's about the money.,2,2,5,1,October 20 2024
This was the first time for my friends and wife and second time after 5 years. I miss the prime rib bones. But they now have some of the best beef choices like prime rib. beef brisket. and lots of other choices. I’m a fan of warm crab legs. However. they only heat the king crab legs and none of the other seafoods like dungeness crab. Going early in the evening allowed us to enjoy the rest of the Caesars property before going home. Dessert bar was adequate but not over the top like the food stations. Parking rates disappointed us. You have to know where to park in the massive parking garage.,4,4,5,4,October 19 2024
muy buen buffet. la variedad es muy buena. el servicio bastante bueno. la gente de recepción no es amable ( a diferencia de las cajeras. que si lo son ) el precio aceptable.,5,5,5,4,October 19 2024
Overrated. poor quality. dirty and terrible service. I did not like the experience.,1,2,1,1,October 19 2024
It's a buffet.  Lots of options. crab legs unlimited,4,4,4,4,October 19 2024
Excellent choices of food. Anything and everything you could think of: Chinese. Japanese. Korean. Mexican. and tons of seafood! Love it. This is my “Go to” buffet when I’m in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
When I check online the brunch is only $41.99 plus tax but when we get there we paid $100 more each🙈too expensive. They don’t even have lobster🙈,3,3,3,3,October 19 2024
I wish I had taken more photos! Omg this was on my bucket list for the weekend and this buffet did NOT disappoint. There is a mind blowing variety of cuisines from all over the world. Everything that I got from food to drinks was absolutely delicious. It’s pricey but so worth it!,5,5,4,5,October 19 2024
my favorite Buffett in Vegas .  the blueberry colored horchata  is amazing,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Wenn man in Vegas ist. muss man das Buffet definitiv ausprobieren. denn es ist eine Erfahrung wert. Eine sehr große Auswahl an unterschiedlichen Küchen und Gerichten. Hier ist was für jeden dabei! Der Service ist freundlich und schnell. Das Essen war von einer super Qualität und sehr lecker!,5,5,5,4,October 19 2024
This is my second time eating here.  This time I came for brunch (when they opened).  The food seemed much better and it was not as crowded.  Don’t get me wrong my first time was “shock and awe”.  But coming earlier the whole experience seemed much better.  The food choices are amazing!  Our waiter was awesome in taking of our needs and keeping our glasses full.  Can’t wait to go again.  Make sure you make reservations before you arrive or your wait will be long.,5,5,5,4,October 19 2024
Thanks to the staff who helped make our dining experience great. The greeter at the door was able to get us in in a timely manner which we appreciated!  The selection was awesome!  I have food sensitivities so I was really happy to see how the food was labelled so well. This made my dinning experience that much more enjoyable.,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Couldn't get in. Arrived 130pm. 5pm i was 42nd on the list. Since I was 1 person they kept sitting parties of 4 or more when those tables came available. It was Friday so I understand it was busy but to keep sitting larger parties and skipping me was ridiculous. I finally gave up and caught ubber to Fogo De Cho and was sat within 10 minutes of arrival.,1,5,5,5,October 19 2024
The host seating us was very rude and yelled profanities at us. We asked to speak to the manager but were stonewalled. Servers serving our table were nice and attentive. Food was mediocre. it used to be better.,2,3,3,3,October 19 2024
We had a booking at 9.45pm and upon arrival we were told we would have 1 hour so we already felt rushed. All the food was cold. tasted like it had been lying for hours. The cut meat tasted like a grill not tasty at all. Overall the food was so disappointing and not worth the money.,1,1,3,2,October 19 2024
Excellent food and service. will definitely return every time going to Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Great atmosphere and even better food. 10/10 definitely worth every penny,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Amazing Selection of Seafood and Meat Options. The experience is only 1.5 hours. i feel this is a bit short for the Price/Person. Otherwise Spectacular.,5,5,5,4,October 18 2024
Pricy. most sea food are mediocre. lobster claw are taste less. 90 minutes limit was kinda rush. Not recommended.,2,2,2,5,October 18 2024
Universally. every review said this was best Vegas buffet. I just don’t see it. Huge selection but everything was “meh”. No bad. But also not good. Disappointed after all the hype.,3,2,4,2,October 18 2024
If you like amazing buffets. this is for you. Too much food for me and a bit pricey.,4,4,4,4,October 18 2024
Everything was amazing fresh tasty seasoned and so many options!!!,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
The food was great! Especially the brisket and the king crab leg. The service was amazing. our server Felipe atteneded to our table promptly and was always willing to accommodate with great attention to detail.,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
Be advised Lobster doesn't come out until 3 pm. and the claws we had were either extremely overcooked and left to sit in ice (oxidization) or they were frozen.  Service was good. seems they're short staffed.,2,2,5,3,October 18 2024
Food was a little cold switching between breakfast/lunch. These foods were: Alaskan Crab Legs. Meatballs. and the Prime Rib Steak,5,4,5,5,October 18 2024
a must do in Vegas. Food was excellent. some items available for just breakfast/ brunch. others are added for dinner.,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
I went there at 9 AM mainly for breakfast. but all items were available.  I wish there was just a breakfast buffet. That was less expensive.. the price was $94 but thankfully my bill was comped.  Not sure if I would go back for breakfast if I had to pay for it on my own. Overall food quality was great. Service was terrific.,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
Visited this venue on 18th oct 2024 with 2 friends .  I was recommended but sadly it didn't live up to expectations.  Being a seafood fan . this wasn't the best ! I'm probably being fussy plus the big hype around this venue .left all 3 of us slightly disappointed! Food in general was of good standard. Having booked for 930. We had to still que and wait. Which we found frustrating.  Overall. the experience was ok. I wouldn't rush back. though .,4,3,4,3,October 18 2024
I felt the price did not reflect the variety in food. The seating area is large but the amount being offered is quite small,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
For being such a highly rated buffet this was such a disappointment. The food was not fresh and we struggled to find things that were actually good. Such a bummer!,1,1,2,3,October 18 2024
Nice selection toon but good was basic crowd-convention quality. Very expensive for minimally acceptable food and service.,3,3,3,2,October 17 2024
Wait time to get seated was short.  Asked for a table instead of a booth and I was told that we will have to wait again so my group had no other choice. Line to get bacon was ridiculous due to the line going to the ham and the steak; the line to the bacon was blocked and I felt obliged to go in line in order to get to the bacon. For the price I paid I had 2 half filled plate because I was just lazy to go in line to get food.  I was very excited to bring my family to this buffet but the experience was a let down.  I heard the conversations of the three tables right beside us. I had to talk over them for my family to hear me.  Not sure if I’ll bring my family here again on our next visit to Las Vegas.  On a lighter note. our server was great. on point with drink refills.,3,3,3,2,October 17 2024
Customer service was great!! Food was fresh and variety of food.,5,4,5,5,October 17 2024
Too expensive and low quantity food，for example. the shrimp is not fresh. the oyster didn’t taste any oyster. too much spinach. and too salty. The lobster only the Lobster Claws which no taste good. Overall not worth it for the price.,2,2,5,5,October 17 2024
food selection was incredible. Loved all the beef options. Dessert bar was way more than anyone person could eat.,5,5,4,5,October 17 2024
We went to another casino’s AYCE snow crab prior to having dinner at the Bacchanal. It was good but we were disappointed with the variety on the buffet.  The Bacchanal blew us away both in the variety offered and the quality and taste of the food. We enjoyed ourselves so much we went back a second time! Highly recommended,5,5,5,5,October 17 2024
We enjoyed the variety of food which was delicious. We visit here at least once every trip to LV.,5,5,5,5,October 17 2024
Really good fantastic food and good customer service,5,5,5,5,October 17 2024
Great food if you are willing to wait..................,5,5,4,3,October 17 2024
Way overpriced for the quality of food.  Some selections had been sitting for quite awhile and others were not well stocked. The desserts were somewhat tasteless and bland. This buffet was average and not as exceptional as I was expecting for the price.  Don't think we'll be going back here. I'm certain there are other buffets that offer better food for a much lower price.,2,2,5,3,October 16 2024
Perfect for craving seafood!  Price can be adjusted to accommodate big party. Overall great experience!,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Excelente comida. El buffet más delicioso que hemos comido. Tener paciencia en la fila de entrada.,4,5,4,5,October 16 2024
Great food and service / staff make you  feel very confortable,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Food quality is inconsistent. Brisket and bacon were good. Asian and Mexican section were lackluster. Dessert section was very good. Lobster claws were overcooked. Stick with the crab legs. Smoked salmon cream was good. but a little too much smokiness. Servers were great and on top of clearing plates frequently and refilling drinks. The better buffet is down the street. rhymes with win.,4,4,5,3,October 16 2024
The buffet was great. We were staying at Caesar's while attending a conference and decided to eat at the buffet with dinner around 6:30 pm. The steamed seafood selection was my target. and it was great! I'm My favorite food is pasta. and I was a little disappointed at the 2 pasta dishes. which appeared to be dry. and food scattered amongst the bar area.  The Asian food selections was awesome!,4,4,5,5,October 16 2024
The price was a little steep. but it's by far one of the best buffets I've ever eaten.,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Great Buffet good idea to make a reservation easier to get through the line,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Lovely buffet. Food was amazing. Loved the posole. The floor was structured very poorly causing lot of chaos around the food. It was very busy and crowded. But if you love food definitely try it here.,4,5,4,2,October 16 2024
Had a 5 pm reservation and arrived early. They had me get in line but as I moved closer they still hadn't charged me. I asked when would they charge me and then they did. Got my table at 5:30. Put my drink order in and headed for the food stations. Everything was good save for the turkey which was kind of dry. Desert was amazing. It was a pleasant experience overall.,5,5,4,5,October 16 2024
If you are a picky eater. this is not the place for you. I am picky and it was very hard for me to find something I would like. The pizza was cold and old.  I like the make stations. I made a plain pasta. Other than that the foods are way too authentic for me. which I am sure others will love. Huge seafood buffet area also. I don’t like seafood either. Desserts were plentiful and that’s where I was able to find things to eat. They are more plain for my choosing.,2,2,2,3,October 15 2024
Increíble! El mejor buffet de las Vegas. Los mariscos espectaculares,5,5,5,5,October 15 2024
I was in town for a conference and had dinner with some new colleagues. The spread was amazing and all the food was great. We enjoyed everything we ate and our server was nice and attentive as well.,5,4,5,5,October 15 2024
We had Mark/Marc and he was awesome!! He was very kind and informative and we hope we get him when we come again,5,5,5,3,October 15 2024
This is my favorite buffet in Vegas. I have been dozens of times. and brought family members from all over the US each year to join my husband and I at our favorite restaurant. This was the worst experience I have ever had. We went on Columbus Day. and the buffet was so crowded. I couldn’t even get any crab! There was a constant line of 40-50 people waiting for one station of crab for the entire 90 min dinner. The rest of the buffet was very messy. with spills everywhere. and no one cleaning anything. It was pure chaos at 7pm when we dined. We had to flag down a waitress to get our drinks and she never came back to check on us. Terrible experience. so very disappointing.,1,2,1,1,October 15 2024
As promised. the bacchanal buffet has so much food selection. It is quite easy to get full easily if you don’t plan effectively of what to eat. If you like eating crab legs and lobster claws. you are covered in this buffet. However. this time I went. I would say that the lobster claws were over cooked since it was a bit rubbery!  But don’t make that deter you from eating the other wonderful selections of what Bacchanal has to offer! My party and I really enjoyed the dessert selection since there was a crepe section!,4,4,5,4,October 15 2024
Great choices. the desserts were amazing. the king crabs were tasty. soda drinks included in the package you paid. Good ambiance and organize for lining up for the table. We had fun for our dinner.,5,5,5,5,October 15 2024
The food was very good.  The only issue I had was most of the crab and lobster was served cold.  I want my crab and lobster to be hot.  It lacked flavor because of it.,4,4,3,3,October 15 2024
Great selection and excellent service by the staff. Food stations were maintained appropriately and efficiently.,5,5,5,4,October 14 2024
Everything you can imagine is on this buffet.  Be sure to go there hungry.,5,5,5,5,October 14 2024
The app and website didn’t tell you lobster claws serving time.Lobster claws are served during dinner time only. From 3pm till closing.,4,5,5,4,October 14 2024
We went for Sunday brunch at noon.  Even with a reservation. had to wait a good 1/2 hour + to go in.  I expected more food choices.  Two asian dishes and 2 choices for sushi were dissapointing.  The tri-tip beef and the gyro were good.  The mini burger had a dried out bun from sitting under the lights.  Crab was a good quality.,3,3,3,3,October 14 2024
Lots of options.Food was great! Service was good. The tables were just ok,5,5,5,5,October 14 2024
Really sad to see the price has gone up but the quality has gone down. Lots of cheap filler items whereas previously they had a variety of interesting small bites. Most of the meat items I had were tough and chewy. the brisket dry and stringy. Asian food was passable but the entrees are fresher better cooked at Panda Express. Battered items were pasty and gummy. At over one hundred bucks all-in I expect to feel impressed. but that was anything but the case.,4,3,4,3,October 14 2024
VERY EXPENSIVE for the quality of food.  For the price. it would be advised to go somewhere for a sit down dinner with better quality food. not as much chaos. and much better service.,2,2,1,2,October 14 2024
I remember a while ago this used to be the best buffet in Vegas. but that’s not the case anymore. I feel the quality is gone down. The variety has decreased. and I got sick from the lobster claws. They were old and dry. ￼,2,2,4,3,October 14 2024
The food is below average. maybe I am bias because I am from Houston which has great seafood buffets and restaurants. it doesn’t have sign so the lay out is confusing. We have to ask the waiter where was the Asian station at. and it was hidden.  The cost is expensive.  The seafood was below average.,3,2,5,3,October 14 2024
The food was ok. Crab was ok. Sushi ok. Nothing really stood out as amazing,3,3,5,5,October 14 2024
The best buffet in Vegas. so much to choose from and the different chefs are always on hand to coax you into trying a taste of something new. The lobster was a highlight for me. the lady who served the iced water saw me struggling to open it and she bought some cutters and taught me how to remove the flesh in around 10 seconds. We have returned again and it just seems to get better,5,5,5,5,October 14 2024
Tipping up front is a bad business model. It's extortion by implied threat of bad service. Which is exactly what happened to me. I usually pay tips in cash. When a server sees my receipt. no tip on it. who knows what goes through their head. However. the employer set the expectation for a server to see the tip up front. I got terrible service. even though I planned on tipping cash. Until this model is changed. I probably will not be back.,4,5,3,5,October 14 2024
Definitely not worth the cost. The food was mediocre at best.,2,2,1,3,October 14 2024
I have been to the Bacchanal Buffet about 10 years ago and it was fantastic. Looking forward to it. we invited some of our friends to dinner our first night in Vegas.  When we arrived. we were greeted and seated almost immediately. Everyone in our group was literally on the brink of starvation as no one really at earlier in the day to prepare for scrumptious  meal.  Immediately heading for the meat stations. we partook in the fresh carved turkey. prime rib. and brisket before moving slightly east to the seafood station.  After sitting back down at our table. forks and knives in hand. we dove in only to find everything was Luke warm at best.  This was such a disappointment from our last experience years prior. not to mention the cost of the buffet.  When one pays $112 (after tax and tip) per person. you kind of expect better.  Round two was in the Asian and Italian sections. With the exception of the freshly made pasta. everything was cold. including the pig.  Based on every hot item being cold. I unfortunately could not recommend the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar’s Palace. ￼,3,3,3,5,October 14 2024
Service and variety was great but most of the hot seafood was cold or just warm,3,3,5,5,October 13 2024
Food is presented fabulously but tastes cheap and bland. Typical casino style fare. The only decent thing is the crab legs and still those were tough and bland. Unless you’re dead set on a buffet experience. find a better restaurant with less of a cafeteria vibe.,3,3,4,3,October 13 2024
Most of the food was cold. needed more flavor and the desert area didnt have a lot of the  items.,3,2,3,3,October 13 2024
Have eaten here many times. Not as good this time. Brisket had a lot fat. Prime rib was not as good as previously. Street tacos were greasy and tough. Salads were fresh    Cinnamon roll delicious.,4,3,4,3,October 13 2024
The service was very bad. They didn’t give us the crab cracker till the very end. Didn’t ask for drinks. Though had variety of cuisines were available. for all cuisines taste was mediocre.,1,3,1,3,October 13 2024
Oh boy. we are not buffet people. but this was supposed to be a good one. Took our teen boys there as a fun surprise. but not one item was actually good. It's just overload of very poor quality food. I don't know that I had high expectations. but it was veryyyyy expensive and there was a weekend Seafood upcharge. Just...no...,1,1,1,1,October 13 2024
Great food as always. I need my meat well done unfortunately and the cooks were able to  cook me some well done prime rib. The food was good as always. There was a great variety and we were sat quickly after our open table reservation time.,5,5,5,5,October 13 2024
Our group of 4 had a great experience!  We really enjoyed the Prime Rib and Crab Legs and everything in between! Our server was so helpful and helped make our first visit wonderful. Everything was clean and the atmosphere was very good. We will definitely be back!,5,5,5,5,October 13 2024
$90. not worth the price. The quality is overrated.    I had to go get my own refill on my tea.,2,4,1,4,October 13 2024
"This is the second time I have been here. (First time was probably 5 years ago).  Never disappoints.  Plenty of food options.  My only disappointment was there were no Oysters on the half shell. :(     They were so good last time.  The gal that we checked in with was super accommodating!  We got there early and she arranged it so we could get right in.   Took our time and ate until we were full .  90 minutes was plenty of time.   Dessert bar was fabulous.  Our ""server"" was very nice. explained things well and was on top of our drinks the whole time.  Overall a great place to eat while in Vegas. and the price was reasonable.",5,5,5,4,October 12 2024
Food was cold. not that much variety. I felt sick after eating there. The price was way too much for what you get. I would never eat again and wish I never wasted my money there.,1,1,1,1,October 12 2024
Beautiful restaurant!  Food choices were abundant - charged for food before you even walk in. then have to pay for our drinks as soon as they’re set down on your table. Chocolate chip cookies were amazing and so was the dessert bar. Expensive though!,4,3,4,5,October 12 2024
The buffet was an experience but I don’t believe worth the value.,3,3,4,4,October 12 2024
Buffett had innumerable delicious options. Would return.,5,4,3,5,October 12 2024
Great buffet. Our server only took our drink order and cleared our table once. He was always nearby but didn’t come to us to help refill our drinks. The check in line also is very confusing with unkind female employees.,4,5,1,5,October 12 2024
The place was amazing. My wife has celiac disease and we spoke to chef Daniel. He was so informative and guided us through each section of food that was gluten free. He was very proud of what they had to offer and he was truly one of a kind spending as much time with us as needed. The food was delicious and more than you could imagine. They gave a 90 minute time limit which you would think would be enough but it’s not. There’s just so much to choose from and  if you want a little of everything the time going fast. Overall we will eat there on every future trip to Vegas. Out thanks to all that we encountered.,5,5,5,5,October 12 2024
Very great place. go with an empty stomach. Lol. got in pretty close to my reservation. Staff was great. a little slow on drink refills. All of us enjoyed it and will be back.,5,5,4,5,October 12 2024
This buffet was HUGE! I was blown away by the variety of choices from Lobster to Chinese it has everything anyone could want! Definitely earned its label as one of the best buffets in Vegas.,4,3,5,5,October 12 2024
The mussels made me and my sister sick after eating it. The crab legs were good though!,3,3,3,3,October 12 2024
Overpriced.  Not many vegetarian options Overpriced.,1,1,1,4,October 12 2024
Food and service was excellent. open table reservations 2weeks before we came showed 4:30 and 10pm as the only available seating but when we got there this was not true and several people were just walking in.  This was very disappointing.  Open table is a scam. The price also was extremely high. We are not big eaters so clearly you are paying for the gluttons that come to overindulge. Our occasion was a 21st bday so we were willing to pay for a nice meal but probably would not spend this much again with so many less expensive places to eat in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
Way overpriced! Lots of choices but poor quality! Will not go back!,3,2,3,3,October 11 2024
The food was delicious and the service was great. The line to get in was long but moved rapidly. My only complaint was the variety - for the price. I expected a much larger selection of items. But overall it was good and I would consider eating there again.,4,4,5,5,October 11 2024
I’ve been here before and loved the food.  However this time. my friends and I came again for dinner. but the food was just ok. I think it was the type of food options they offered or something was “off”.    Plus the service was slow and it wasn’t a full house (we came in at 4pm so it was still early).  But overall. Bacchanal Buffet is still one of the best buffets in Las Vegas.,4,3,3,3,October 11 2024
Great buffet with a huge selection of food with decent quality. Quite pricey though and 90 minutes is too short of a buffet. It should be min 120 mins instead,4,4,4,4,October 11 2024
The food was excellent but is it really worth over 100$ per ? It depends if you have a large appetite for seafood . It is quite a sight !,4,5,5,3,October 11 2024
A lot of crabs but didn’t see any king crabs & lobster claws.,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
In this day and age I assumed there would have been (at least) a tiny section of gluten free items. There was not. I finally found a pasta station with gluten free pasta. only to have them throw it in the same water. at the same time. as regular noodles.  So if you are celiac do not go there. I basically spent $85 for Diet Coke…,1,1,1,4,October 11 2024
Server was inattentive. Had to ask several times for water. Food was average.,4,4,3,5,October 11 2024
Was worth every penny! I sampled everything and was excellent! I would Go back again!!!,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
It is the most over rated dinning experience in Vegas!   It has plenty of variety but it is still just a buffet. Don’t waste your money.,2,2,2,2,October 11 2024
Food was just passable. Lobster claws were awful. Price was exorbitant. Do yourself a favor and skip it. Ripoff.,1,1,3,2,October 10 2024
Easy check in process. Food was okay quite salty but selections were plenty.,3,3,3,3,October 10 2024
Two people 180 USD …. A lot of items. but relatively cheap food.  Chinese dim sum… they are all cool from I started eating until I finished.  Still cold.   They watsed the seafood as well. and not much seafood choice.  A lot I meant a lot of pretty desert. yes pretty only that’s it,1,1,2,1,October 10 2024
Loved the Clams and Crab.  My sister said the Frog Legs 🦵 were really tasty.  The Dim Sum offerings were passable.  The vegetable salads were great.  Nice assortment of desserts.,4,4,5,5,October 10 2024
We did not go in. after standing in line then  being told to go scan codes (2codes available). scanned the code went back in the queue to be told that the code wasn’t working to go use another one which we did . then back in the queue to be told wait over their and wait on a message. Then other groups done the same a got in straight away then they decided to shout on us and said just come in so back in another queue which was massive by then we had enough so just left.,1,1,1,1,October 10 2024
Crab was good rest was beyond average xxxxxxxxxxxx,3,3,3,3,October 10 2024
Second time eating at bacchanal. The experience was enjoyable and offered a wide variety of food. During the second time some of the food seemed kind of dry. specifically the pig and brisket. Still enjoyable. I believe it is a little steep in price but if you want a quality spread. checking it out once is a good experience.,3,3,3,2,October 10 2024
The Baccanal buffet was a miss for me this year. I went here for my birthday LAST year and the food was great And the seafood was fresh.  This year the seafood did not seem fresh at all. We drove all the way from San Diego . paid $184 to eat here. only to start off with the shrimp (tasted old mushy and powdery) and the lobster claws ( dry and tasteless) that killed my appetite for the rest of the food. At least the asian food was fresh. Our server Marta was nowhere to be found at times. Icame to celebrate my birthday to eat great food like I did last year here only to be sorely disappointed!!! For the price we pay to eat here … at least be consistant!!,2,1,1,3,October 10 2024
Nice service with good food. Especially snow crab was awesome.,5,5,5,5,October 10 2024
The price was outrageous! There were a lot of options but the quality of food was eh. It wasn't very hot and chips were stale. There also weren't any options that were oh my gosh I've not had that before. Not very flavorful!,2,1,2,1,October 10 2024
I love this buffet can go back everytime I go Vegas,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
菜種類多樣、各國料理口味非常道地！ 服務人員態度尚可，可能是因為服務的客人太多！ 等候進場時間過久，建議加快速度或增加人手！,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
Just So so. Not value   They asks for tips before eat.  But no good service. And some dood not fresh.,3,3,3,3,October 9 2024
Thr food was good. Some of the meats were a little dry but overall the majority of the food I ate were tasty amd flavorful.,5,5,4,5,October 9 2024
Foods are not good. There is nothing that I felt tasting good. And our server didn't come to check on us for the whole time. plates got piled up on our table and no one even care to take those.,1,1,1,3,October 9 2024
Food is absolutely worth it! Massive selection of meats. seafood. and ethnic dishes. The service was a slow when it came to paying for our drinks at the end. but our table was cleared of empty dishes promptly. Great experience. would definitely reccomend,4,5,3,5,October 9 2024
This buffet offers a wide variety of foods which were mostly fresh. There were some items we felt were not very creative or tasty. The  experience for you if you feel you will eat enough to justify the $90 per person price. The beverage service at the table was very poor. and removal of dirty plates was very poor. We felt that the server was not attentive nor welcoming or friendly. They ask you to tip when you pay. my suggestion is to wait and leave cash based on the experience and service you receive. We did that. and were happy that we had not pre-tipped 20%.  Overall. I would not do this again. and would choose to eat at a menu based restaurant.,3,3,1,3,October 9 2024
It was the worst buffet I’ve ever been too. Caterer toward Asia food which I don’t like. I am a picky eater but I only found one thing that was good. It was the potatoes. Even the deserts were not good. I did like the ice cream. So I paid $90 plus tip for ice cream and mashed potatoes.,1,1,3,3,October 9 2024
Las patas de cangrejo y de langosta estaban exgeradamente saladas que mi pareja y yo no pudimos comerlas,4,3,4,4,October 8 2024
The server that was getting us drinks and taking the plates had a attitude. I tried to conversate and tip her at the start to try to up her moral. but it did nit change. My friends and family was affected by her attitude. which ruined the experience. The food was really good. but i dont feel like it was trully worth it. Pretty loud in the buffet but was a lot of people.  And so many people just walking into each other was kinda a headache going through the buffet and people rushing cause of the time limit to eat and bumping into you.,4,5,3,4,October 8 2024
There is an ample amount of variety at this buffet. including pizza. seafood and vegan options. Unlike other buffets. the food was actually seasoned. which was nice. I was very excited for the dessert Ísland. but ended up being very disappointed. The desserts were mediocre. at best. Again. a large variety. but the taste and quality weren’t there. I suppose you can’t expect much from a buffet that caters to hundreds of people each day. that’s a huge undertaking and quality control has to be extremely difficult. That said. unless you’re a huge eater or only eat prime rib and crab legs. this buffet is very expensive. It was $92 (with taxes & fees) for one person. I definitely wasn’t able to eat my money’s worth. The servers were all very friendly and my table was comfortable and clean. I’m glad I went. as it’s been a thing I’ve wanted to do while in Vegas. but doubt I’ll return for the sheer cost alone.,5,3,5,3,October 8 2024
A total ripoff. Good and service terrible. All of the meats were dry. The crab was so over steamed that the shells wouldn’t crack and it was hard to get the meat out. Would not recommend a waste of $200,1,1,1,3,October 8 2024
The food was good. but I was a little disappointed at the variety in the Asia section.  Was looking forward to ramen. bulgoki. or more fish-based dishes.  Didn't see them.  It was delicious. anyway.,4,4,5,5,October 8 2024
We went after a show and it was good. Lots of dirty tables still from the dinner rush. but the buffet was still fully stocked. and the servers attentive.,4,4,5,3,October 8 2024
Food was all pretty good.prime rib was excellent. sushi also good crab and lobster good. Clearing of plates after a course mediocre at best,4,4,3,3,October 8 2024
My wife and I have gone there for the past couple of years and their quality is still top notch!!! Their price is still a little bit up there for me. but quality over price I can handle… reservation is the best way to go and always get the Ube Horchata… it tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch at the end of a bowl. iykyk… 90 minutes is worth every penny!!! 4-5x$20 equals your moneys worth… awesome buffet!!!,5,5,5,5,October 8 2024
I have eaten here in both peak & off season. The food is always excellent and consistent. Well worth the price especially for those that like crab & seafood.  It’s not your typical buffet with low quality food. It gets busy so make sure you make reservations ahead of time especially if you have a big group. The service is excellent as well. Staff is very attentive to bringing drinks & clearing plates.,5,5,5,5,October 8 2024
Most of the food was cold. The only hot food was the meat on the carving station. Huge waste of money,2,2,2,2,October 8 2024
Absolutely.  positively the best buffet experience I've ever had. no waiting for food. it's available constantly and consistently. The quality of the food is exceptional the staff was very accommodating. Price was a bit higher than I thought especially since there was no King Crab served. But overall. if you're ever in Vegas. this place is a MUST! 9/10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
They have good food selections and the prime rib was delicious. Other than that it’s just a typical buffet…,3,3,2,2,October 7 2024
Great Foods. Great Service! I never thought I will be served drinks in buffet. Thank you.,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
Brisket and Hash were absolutely delicious. A bit expensive for someone who doesn't have a huge appetite.,4,5,4,4,October 7 2024
On average. breakfast buffet is $10-$15 more per person than other Vegas buffets. However. the selection and freshness and service far exceed any other's offering. You will not be disappointed.  Not a complete Vegas trip without Bachanal Buffet visit.,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
Dinner was almost $100/person after taxes.  Food was VERY subpar.  The stand out winners were the meat carving station (brisket and tri-tip were amazing!). the fresh sushi and actually most of the Asian offerings and the pozole and Vampiro tacos.  Everything else was average or below.  We tried 10 different desserts and only the Oreo tiramisu was worth taking more than 1 bite.  We were very disappointed in the quality of the food offered. especially for the price and hype.  Staff was very friendly but you don't go to the buffet for the service.,3,2,5,4,October 7 2024
Too much food its one of those adages too many things and nothing is done well. I should have kept my reservation at Amalfi as maybe the one thing I ordered would have been done perfectly and maybe at the same price. If your a Buffet person and can put it down. go for it. It was fun and no regrets. next time. not. Vegas is about the experience. Live it up or stay home. Caesars is the best on the strip.,3,2,5,4,October 7 2024
The was a variety of so many different types of food.    You don't have the ability to try everything.  presentation was great.   You can't go wrong.,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
Great selection of meats. roasted veggies. Asian section was great and of course if you love seafood definitely start with that. Rushing to sample food in a  90 min window is not ideal. The mousse based desserts were the best… Creme brulee pot was a perfect size to sample and do creamy. You should visit at least once.,5,4,5,5,October 7 2024
The brisket was absolutely amazing.  The service was great.,5,5,5,3,October 7 2024
"The only quality item was the prime rib. The turkey was decent.  Seafood was old. frozen tasting.  Lobster claws had terrible texture and none of the sweet tastes of fresh lobster. Major disappointment.  Wanted to experience a""vegas"" buffet.  Seriously.  enjoyed golden corral more",2,2,5,3,October 6 2024
We made a reservation for 3:30pm. We decided to come early to see if we could get seated earlier. We were accommodated. The food was delicious. An abundance of seafood. different varieties of meat. different cuisines. No complaints except that I wish I could have eaten more.,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
Really hard to get into but I’m glad I got it to go. The only thing that I’ve sent me is I cleared my table while I was at the buffet and took my purse away. I wasn’t really gone that long. ￼,3,5,2,3,October 6 2024
The food was delicious! Make sure you go hungry and are are ready to indulge!,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
There was a wide variety of food and what I had was very good.  Unfortunately it was extremely crowded and loud.  I guess I prefer a restaurant with less noise. etc.. but I guess that is what a buffet is with crowded tables and people.,4,4,3,2,October 6 2024
Quality food was amazing. variety of food was from all over the pace attracting people from all over the place. I would go back in a heartbeat,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
We always look forward to our brunch visit here while in town.  and always ensure to book our reservation early as our stop here is an essential part of our trip. We did not appreciate the self check-in kiosk - as it took several attempts to get this right. and there was no prompt to include your Rewards Card - and now this requires a seperate stop back in the casino area. plus wait time to get this entered.   As we said did not appreciate this part of the process.  As far the Brunch. as usual the food was great. vaired. plentiful and refreshed. Our sever Geno. was friendly. attentive and we enjoyed his service during our visit. Look forward to the next time.,5,4,4,3,October 6 2024
The food not even that good just regular buffet but the guy at the steak section has attitude. I am there to eat free stuff to beg him cutting me steak.,2,2,3,3,October 6 2024
Always a good experience when we come here! We love this place and all it has to offer!,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
The service here is outstanding- from the host to the servers to the folks working behind the food counters. Unfortunately the food was to be expected from a buffet: pretty bland. overdone. and definitely overpriced.,3,3,5,4,October 6 2024
Love. love seafood. This is a great buffet. If you’re a seafood lover Caesars is my favorite place.,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
It's not a good value for the price charged compared to other higher-end buffets.,1,1,4,2,October 6 2024
We were told that we can stay until we finish eating but we were force to leave at 11 pm. I did not get to finish eating because we were force to leave.,4,4,4,4,October 6 2024
very bad service! They made us register and wait for our turn which did not come! Why isn't it better to say that there is no more and not make us wait without a response?,1,1,1,1,October 6 2024
My wife and I really enjoy the fact that you can get a little taste of different types of food that is very good. The service was excellent.,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
Overrated. Crab claws ok not as fresh. Lobster claws dry. tough and tasteless. Lots of food choices but went there mostly for sea foods but was disappointed . Too expensive for this kind of sea foods offered. Will not go back,2,2,4,4,October 5 2024
Good not great. Felt it was a little overpriced. Limited buffets in Vegas now and this one is essentially the best but still not 5 stars.,4,4,5,3,October 5 2024
Rosa. the reservation host was horrible.Did not greet us with a smile and even had an attitude when we had a question.,3,4,1,4,October 5 2024
overall the food was very good and the amount of choices was fantastic.   in particular the family loved the smoothies!  one disappointment was the featured food item. crab legs.    they were served cold and there was no melted butter available.   so pretty disappointment with this especially since the buffet's theme was crab fest.,5,4,5,5,October 5 2024
We selected the Bacchanal Buffet because it was highly rated on various sites. We were not disappointed. The variety and quality of food was outstanding. with a wide selection of food types representing so many different cuisine styles. For what us on offer. the cost is also very reasonable. I’d happily recommend this to anyone looking for a special dining experience while in Las Vegas.,5,5,4,4,October 5 2024
Disappointed to say the least. I was looking forward to this but was not happy with the experience at all. I expected the cost to be high. because Vegas but for the price I expected some amazing food. The food was mid at best and most of it was sitting under heat lamps. Service is okay. but the buffet itself is a bit dirty. I was expecting to be WOWed based off of everything I read online but left hungry and upset that we spent $200 on something we could have paid a fraction for somewhere else. I’m not one to leave a bad review but if you value your money… don’t do it.,1,1,3,2,October 5 2024
Comida nada fuera de lo común. Lo único que vale la pena son los mariscos. el resto de comida es promedio.,3,2,1,2,October 5 2024
There were three of us at this dinner reservation. We were all disappointed with all the food compared to what we paid. The total amount was $360. including tips for all of us. The highlight of this buffet was king snow crab legs. but there was a long wait line and the worst part was it was too salty. Other types of foods were just okay and a bit salty too. The best foods section was the dessert. It was fantastic. They’ve done a good job. We’re not sure if we should go back again.,2,2,4,4,October 5 2024
Food was good. Glad we tried it. Magnificent crab legs.,4,5,5,5,October 5 2024
Excellent selection and variety of options. 90 min was not enough time to try everything. especially having to wait in some of the lines. The Alaskan king crab legs were delicious and worth the wait. Save time and room for dessert.,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
Delicious variety of foods Great  atmosphere and experience,5,5,3,4,October 4 2024
Our server took a very long time to get our drink order. He never came back to check on us.  I have eaten there many times and always had good service.  I am just taking a guess but being seniors might have something to do with this lack of service.  I have noticed this in several Vegas restaurants.,3,3,1,3,October 4 2024
Everything was delicious! I go back every year. Crab legs are my favorite there. I am just sad I missed the crepes I didn’t realized there had them there until after I was done.,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
They give you a 1.5 hour time limit. which most don't need anyway. but just knowing you're on a time limit makes it feel rushed.  Large variety of food but I don't think anyone at our table of 9 ate enough to justify the price.  I'll go back to Wynn next time. The layout there is better and you're not timed.,4,4,5,5,October 4 2024
Great experience as always at Caesars Buffet! Great quality food,5,5,4,4,October 4 2024
The food was amazing. The crab was out of this world,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
If you like buffet in Vegas. you should give it try,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
Juan G great server! We had and excellent experience,5,5,5,4,October 4 2024
Food was good overall.  Nice selection of offerings. Crabb legs were excellent but lobster claw was very dry. Had to wait quite a while to be seated. even with reservation.,4,5,4,4,October 4 2024
We went for crab. but found it was bit disappointing. No King Crab. just snow crab. And Dungeness tasted watery (like from frozen). Lacked true crab flavor. Prime rib was Okay only. Dessert offering was nice and good.,3,3,4,3,October 4 2024
Everything was wonderful from checking in to leaving. Service was great. no waiting.,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
It didn’t live up to the hype for me unfortunately. The cold shellfish was fresh and the main event for sure. Loved the cold lobster. shrimp. and crab legs.   The hot plates I tried were room temp to cold more often than not. (The dim sum was hard and cold. for instance.) The carving station meat tasted weird. The only cut that I enjoyed was the brisket. The truffle whipped potatoes and cream spinach were amazing and actually warm.   Finally. the unfortunate issue of the desserts: horrible. Shocked that a buffet of this caliber messed up so badly. I spat out the first bite of nearly everything I tried: cheesecake. banana pie. Oreo tiramisu. Their texture and temperature was weird. The flavors tasted artificial. Bleh. The only redeeming ones were  orange cream cake. chocolate mousse and lemon gelato. (The watermelon gelato tasted like old watermelon was used / was funky and the cappuccino wasn’t quite right either.)  All in all. it was okay. The few good items made me not fully regret the experience but I wouldn’t go back. I’m pretty bummed. I was so excited and wanted it to be worth the buzz so badly but it was a major miss more than win for me. Service was great at least!,3,3,5,4,October 4 2024
Muy bueno la variedad de comida  y la calidad. Los cortes y los mariscos lo que más me gustó,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
Wonderful as always!! Unlike some people we always see the buffet as more of an experience rather than the opportunity to fill up on as much food as possible!!! We pick bits of what we like but don’t see the necessity to try every single item in huge amounts. It’s debatable whether we eat out money’s worth but seeing as we travel from the UK to Vegas once a year we see this as a treat and don’t mind splashing out. The quality is so good.  The food itself was beautiful. well presented and warm enough to eat straight away.  I felt that the desserts had improved from last year too. Please never ever take away my favourite banana pudding from the menu. but I would’ve loved to see a Key Lime or Lemon Meringue pie added.  The Bacchanal will always be our buffet of choice!!,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
Loved all the options!! Everything was labeled with Allergens which is helpful!,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
The wait was ridiculous. The food was cold. This place is overrated.,1,1,5,2,October 3 2024
It was Very good. the food was amazing. Good seafood.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
The Bacchanal retains their amazing standard. Great food. amazing selection. The time limit of 90 minutes does make it feel quite rushed and doesn’t feel like enough time. Staff were professional and efficient.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
Looked forward to going but was disappointed with both the quality and taste. The attitude and friendliness of the staff was below expectations,3,3,2,4,October 3 2024
The waiting time was very unreasonable. only 5 people were seated after two hours. and the front desk staff was arrogant and very bad.,1,1,1,1,October 3 2024
The variety of food was exceptional & tasted amazing! Was not fond of the Lobster but those crab legs🤤. So much to choose from with plenty of ethnic options😋,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
Really good food and have a lot of choices. Expensive though,5,5,3,4,October 3 2024
Best buffet. lots of food choices and good for a couple’s night out or family dining.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
Absolutely not worth the money. We did not find literally any single item worth remembering. None was flavorful.  All food was brought out oven baked from frozen and boxed packed. I seriously think American food choices and preparation should take its lessons from Asian and middle eastern hospitality.  consumer experience and expectations.  and food preparation from scratch process.,1,1,5,2,October 3 2024
You should tell people that even though you have a reservation you still have to wait an additional 45 mins to get seated. When you are visiting and planning events this is pretty important. I will NEVER come back,1,1,1,1,October 3 2024
Food was delicious! Service was ok. Try the birria tacos. hot snow crab. smoked salmon cone. and pasta station risotto!,4,4,3,3,October 3 2024
food was good and a lot of variety. but only 90 minutes is too rush to enjoy the food and the environment. When you eager to pay 100 US for a dinner. you don't want to just eat the value of the food but enjoy the whole dinner time.,4,5,4,5,October 3 2024
Not really worth ~$90 per person… seafood buffet looked good but not really tasty..,3,3,3,5,October 3 2024
Unfortunately we did not find the #1 buffet in Las Vegas worth the $185.00 (2 people) to be worth it.  We were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation which we appreciated.  The waitress took our drink orders. but that was the last time we saw her.  Although there was a good variety of food. all that we tried was either room temperature when it should have been cold (sushi) or overdone but room temperature like the lamb “T” bones. or so rubbery (crab legs) that you couldn’t snap them to get the meat out.  We were very disappointed in the entire experience.   We will not return.,2,2,3,2,October 3 2024
Very nice restaurant. Fantastic food selection. Really enjoyed the frog legs and bone marrow. Seafood selection was fantastic!,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
El Bachannal Tiene ya varios años y ya no es tan bueno como lo Fue en un inicio. Las manos de cangrejo no están de lo mejor. La Comida es rica pero nada fuera de lo normal y el precio es muy alto. Aunque haya mucha variedad no es posible vale Comerlo todo. Así que si ya lo conoces no hay para que regresar. Y las mesas no las limpian jamás. Puedes tener todos los platos sucios que has ido usando por todo lo Que dures comiendo ahí en la mesa apretados.,3,4,2,3,October 2 2024
We were told to arrive early even though we had reservations because the line moves very slow. I’m extremely happy we did because it does. It felt very unorganized and the staff seemed angry and annoyed for having to answer questions and explain how things work. Prior to arriving I requested a highchair for our eight month old daughter. which was not available when we were seated. I asked for a second time for a highchair and it wasn’t till 30 minutes into the buffet. Did somebody bring us a highchair. Once we were seated. we weren’t sure what the next step was and our server came up to us and said you better get going. This is a time to vent kind of snickered laughed and walked off. so we felt rushed and pushed and things weren’t explained well. The food was good by no means what I say. It’s high end but it was cooked well and there was plenty of options..,3,3,2,3,October 2 2024
Several of my family members were in Vegas for the first time and we wanted them to experience Bacchanal! It did not disappoint! My uncle was in awe! He loved the frog legs!   And by the way. RAMONA IS OUTSTANDING!!,5,5,5,4,October 2 2024
The food is average it’s definitley buffet style food but with a lot of variety. but quality I would always choose over quantity. It was 86$ a person and we did fill up on the red meats and seafood first so we did get our monies worth but it’s more for an experience. We wouldn’t go again. Food was alright most of it cold by the time you get back to the table,3,3,5,5,October 2 2024
Great service. Overall food was amazing. Great value!!,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
Important!  Reservations required!  Not particularly easy to figure out if you haven't done it before.  They are through OpenTable.  If you're there and go by the buffet. there is a place to scan a QR code to make reservations.  Wonderful buffet. It opens into rooms that you don't see at first walk-through. so be sure to search all the nooks and crannies.  Value: I never overstuff myself. so the value for me isn't as good. at $84+ per person. However. the variety is awesome. and I lean towards the seafood and lean meats. as well as a few vegetables. Good little desserts in tiny portions so you can have more than one.  If you are at least Diamond status in Caesars Rewards. be sure and let that be known and you'll be bumped up to the front of a very long line.,5,5,4,4,October 2 2024
Went here with my wife to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and had a great time. The service was excellent. The food was amazing and enjoyed the variety.,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
The best buffet in Vegas. Absolute absurd amount of selection. Crab legs. prime rib. bacon. sushi. and more. Food is great quality and the service is excellent.,5,5,4,5,October 2 2024
Best Buffet in Las Vegas but expensive compared to others. but well worth it.,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
The waitress didn’t remove the dirty plates. The servers weren’t very nice.,1,2,1,1,October 1 2024
Majority of the food was tasty . I did not find anything that blew me out of the water with great flavor. Crepe station was fun to see and staff was kind and professional. I would put them and wicked spoon on similar level and certainly ideal if you just want to try a good quality buffet in Vegas. Definitely better than palms and mgm grand buffet.,3,3,4,4,October 1 2024
Seriously not worth the money ! It took 30 minutes in line to be seated. The line for hot crab legs was  another 15 minutes. The other selections were just ok. absolutely nothing fabulous. Drinks took 20 minutes and coffee still hadn’t arrived by time we finished dessert. Disappointing overall.,2,1,3,2,October 1 2024
Awesome.  yummy Ice cream cones yummy Prime rib Seafood,5,5,5,5,October 1 2024
The restaurant food is great but should have spent time remodelling it's interior and exterior hardware,4,5,5,5,September 30 2024
All you can eat in 90 minutes for family of 7 with 5 growing boys? Challenge accepted! Huge selection of food to cater for everyone’s taste. all of it exceptional quality  Staff and service were perfect,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
Food choice is plenty. its good for all people.  Food quality is just average.  but it fair to the price. the restaurant ambiance is great. as it is well decorated and spacious between tables.  The servers are very friendly too.,4,4,4,5,September 30 2024
Ultimately. the set up was beautiful and very welcoming. However. food was cold. Price wasn’t great for the seafood that was served. Very lacking.,3,3,4,3,September 30 2024
The buffet had many options but almost all the food was not hot.  There was an abundance of seafood.  The meat was ok.  The mexican food was good.  The  beet salad horrible. The asian offerings lacked flavor.  The desserts missed the mark.  I get the price point because of all the offerings but it should taste like it was seasoned and be warm.,3,2,4,4,September 30 2024
My intent when looking up great location to eat was an all you can eat that included lobster. I was very very disappointed . after paying bit over $200. to discover the only lobster available was cold. lobster claw.  After more then 2 plates cracking the small claws & not eating any of the small amount meat found inside I’d given up and made due with other items. This was a birthday trip and my intent was to overload on lobster tails . butter with possibly a side of 1 other protein . Photos & description shown lobster but I may have been deceived . I will never revisit .,1,2,5,2,September 30 2024
Overpriced. Miserable staff. Nice food. Loved the desert bar. Overrated,4,5,3,2,September 30 2024
The food was abundant and delicious! I loved the different ethnic food!  Crab legs were perfect❤️ made all that walking. worthwhile!,5,5,5,4,September 30 2024
We loved our table and server. Excellent drink service. Food selection is unbeatable and high quality.,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Most of the seafood we tried that day tasted like rubber rinsed in salty water. Lobster. snow crab. whelk. shrimp. all tasted the same.  Prime rib and t bone steak were tough and bland.  The desserts were slightly above average.  Paid around 270 usd for 2 adults and 1 child. Not impressed by a single dish. Very disappointed and won’t go back.,1,1,4,1,September 29 2024
Do not waste your money coming here. Food was not good. Everything was room temp and had no seasoning. I was so disappointed we wasted 200 to eat hear. Go somewhere else.,2,1,3,3,September 29 2024
Some food was cold. the seafood was not seasoned correctly. the Mexican food was not the best as other Mexican restaurants. It was too loud too many people trying to get to the food in front of you like they never seen food before. All our host and hostess were very good great service with all that people they continued to do a great job. Some of the chairs the cushions were over used and it seem like I was sinking they need to be replaced. The natural drinks is what I most like. The dessert almost everything had dairy for the people that don’t do dairy is not good. The gelato was not the best. For the price it should be hot food not cold. and better variety. We went twice to experience both lunch and dinner but I was not that impressed.,3,3,5,3,September 29 2024
The food that was plated and left out for us to pick up was not hot. really it was cold.  That was not good for me.  Like the burger sliders and hot dogs for entrance.  Some of the breakfast items as well.  A better warming system should be instituted.,3,3,5,4,September 29 2024
We arrived on a Sunday morning and went straight from the Harry Reid International Airport straight to Caesars Hotel to check-in and was early for our 10:45 AM reservation at the Bacchanal Buffet.  We were seated early and went straight for the food.  Whether it was because we just flew all the way from NY on an overnight flight or perhaps the food just wasn’t as good as we had imagined or hoped but we each only had 1 ½ plates of loosely filled food and a small sampling of desserts.  There was no lack of variety. but I couldn’t say that anything stood out as exceptional or just plain good.  Our bill was $276.32 for 3 people so we definitely did not do it justice like all those YouTubers are always saying that you MUST do.  For this price. we will NOT be going back there again.  One bright spot was our server.  We regret not remembering her name as she was truly lovely.  Sorry but we didn't take any photos as it just didn't wow us enough to do so.,1,1,3,2,September 29 2024
Food was great.  It takes a long time to be seated even with reservations.,4,4,2,4,September 29 2024
Lived up to everything that everyone says it is. One of the best dining experiences that I had in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Would not recommend at all. No value at all to be honest.,2,2,1,1,September 29 2024
Not my first rodeo. I keep going back for a reason,5,4,5,5,September 29 2024
Amazing experience with outstanding options for the entire family. Hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Seafood und Fleisch  und Dessert aber kein Salat - ordentliche Beilagen oder Brot … def total überbewertet.,1,2,4,2,September 29 2024
Fantastic buffet. more food choices than you could imagine. It was a great place to dine.,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Had reservations and still had to get in line with ppl that didn’t have any. I think it prolonged the process and a waste of time. Could’ve been more efficient and have those that have a reservation go directly to register to pay. Food was decent but nothing stood out for the price we paid. Only went to this buffet since my son requested it,4,4,4,3,September 28 2024
Food was amazing! There is a ton of options so even the pickiest eater can find something they’ll love!,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Lots of food choices.  A little expensive on weekends.,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Everything i had was tasty the pork beef roast duck seafood and desserts were fantastic. The turkey wing is got at the carving station was extremely salty that was the only negative thing I experienced.,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
We enjoyed it. Love the food and staff was very attentive,5,5,5,4,September 28 2024
Always a must stop for us anytime we are in vegas,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Vegas buffets aren’t what they used to be. as in- inexpensive. This buffet was worth the price. from endless crab legs to prime rib. As a bonus? The desserts were to die for. Would def go back!!,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Amazing experience. the staff was very nice they took empty plates away so quick so you could go up for seconds or desserts! The variety and flavors were so good. this is a must for anyone taking a trip out there worth every penny and then some!!!,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Worth every penny. Server was attentive and sweet. food was immaculate and the variations and flavors were mind blowing.,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
First of all. I can appreciate the expense of food and the overhead costs associated with the buffet. That said. after visiting. I found it difficult justifying paying $87.99 plus taxes and gratuity per person for the buffet. For the amount of good dishes there were. there was an equal amount that were “meh” at best. I understand it is difficult to make that many items and maintain freshness with the volume required. In my opinion. I would have better been served in dining at a good restaurant and ordering from a menu with the money spent at Bacchanal. Was the buffet horrible? No. Would I return again? No. Like anything out there. opinions will vary. You are allowed 1.5 hours to eat. which is plenty of time but still found it odd to be given a time limit for your meal considering the cost. All the staff were friendly and helpful at the time of my visit. If you are planning to make your first visit. I suggest the following… 1) Watch a couple YouTube videos and see if it really interests you. 2) Be certain to make a reservation. 3) Don’t waste your time filling up with carbs and starches. at least hit the proteins first!,2,2,2,2,September 28 2024
Lobster. I tried twice and spit out both times. gross. dry and no flavor. The prime rib and brisket were dry. Desserts tasted rubbery and our waitress never came until I waived her over for water. I would recommend the Wynn buffet over this one. Please don’t waste your money.  Not worth it and will not recommend.,1,1,1,1,September 28 2024
The whole experience was lackluster.   We made reservations.   Even so. you still have to wait in two different lines. and without our Players Card status. the reservation would have just held our place in line instead of advancing us to the next line.  Caesars really needs to step up their game.  There is no comparison to MGM.  MGM wins hands down.  The food is decent but for $190 for two people. I'd rather eat at a nice sit down restaurant.  Alcoholic beverages are not included either.,3,4,4,3,September 28 2024
I was Forest Gump'd. After the research suggested this was the absolute best buffet in Vegas and their websight showing outstanding photos of the place (Awesome marketing). it really was an average buffet experience. Definitely not worth the $222.00 i paid for 2. Would not go back,2,3,3,3,September 28 2024
Very disappointed. Food was not high quality. Pricing was very steep for that kind of food. The beef choices were ok. Seafood was overcooked and we couldn’t even eat it.,1,1,2,2,September 28 2024
Great dinner!  We do enjoyed and will be back soon!,4,4,5,4,September 27 2024
This is my second time trying the buffet. Both times were a major disappointment. They have variety but food was not good. Quality of food was disappointing. I won’t be dining here anymore.,2,1,4,3,September 27 2024
Really nice place. a lot of options to eat. but it much more expensieve than it was before and they just let you be there 1.5 hours.,5,5,4,5,September 27 2024
If you are going to indulge. this is the place to do it. Each and every dish is delicious. We never had look around to get our  beverages refilled and our empty plates removed. Make sure you save some room for the desserts!,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
My wife and I went for the first time and tried every single item. The only items that tasted okay were the crab legs. the fried frog legs. the crème brûlée. a couple cold cheese slices. and the fruit gelato flavors. The rest either lacked depth in flavor. overcooked. or has inedible texture. like the rock hard bread and patty of the slider burgers. or the crab rangoons that were like a mouth full of lard. We had to chew the prime rib and tri-tip steaks so much until we gave up and couldn’t eat the rest. For being considered a top buffet in Las Vegas. the quality surely does not justify the hype. unless the quality has went down tremendously. We have had better all you can eat experiences for less than half the $85 price tag. Safe to say. we will not return. even for less. because majority of the food simply did not taste good.,1,1,5,4,September 27 2024
Food was good just to expensive and you only get a hr and 30 mins to eat,4,4,4,4,September 27 2024
Delicious food. Great service. We will come back again.,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
No point having a reservation as we then had to line up for 45 mins to be seated. It’s too over priced too. But hey ho that’s vegas.,3,3,2,3,September 27 2024
There is a wide variety of food but not sure the quality matches the price.,4,4,5,4,September 27 2024
Awesome amount of options that are delicious and excellent service.,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
We had a 6:15 reservation and noticed a line so we got in line about 5:50 and we were seated at 6:14. The staff was friendly and the food was fabulous. Worth every penny.,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
The Bacchanal is everything you’ve heard and more.  There is such a variety of different cultures that no matter how much you sample. you feel you’ve missed something.,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
Most expensive buffet I've ever eaten at. Was good but some of the hot dishes were just warm and getting cold as if they were sitting there a long time. You'd think with the price you pay they would monitor the food sitting out alittle better to make sure it is fresh and hot. The tri tip was dry. If you're looking for crab legs this is a good place to get your fix.,4,4,5,4,September 27 2024
Still our favorite buffet in Vegas.  Tried most of the others will always go back to Bacchanal buffet when we’re in Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
The food selection was great and everything tasted wonderful.  They have a great selection of seafood.,5,5,5,4,September 26 2024
Best buffet I have ever had! Tons of cram and I can highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
It was very nice not having to deal with a rush or crowd to eat. I loved it. The cashier also made sure to check her list for the Brunch Special price for my husband and I. I had booked for 10:30am and we arrived a little after (traffic). but she honored it. Super thankful for that. Food was so delicious. The brisket was definitely the highlight for me. Everything was amazing. We will definitely be back!,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
Zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz xzzzzzx zzzzzxx zzzxxxxx,3,3,4,4,September 26 2024
We tried Wynn and Bacchanal. Bacchanal won in everything but both are buffet so the quality would be a little less than a restaurant.  Everything was fresh. with very good flavor and variety.,4,4,5,4,September 26 2024
I’ve been to Bacchanal several times in the past pre-Covid and immediately post-Covid.  I must say that this visit in Sept 2025 has been the most enjoyable.  The food was really. really tasty and the variety has been ever so slightly improved.  Service was on point with drink refills and clearing plates.  And I didn’t feel as time pressured as in the past (90 minute time limit).,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
We really liked when we were greeted with excitement and joy before we entered the restaurant. Food presentation and cleanliness was on point and the lines were moving fast.,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
1st time going to the buffet.  Food was very good and varied.  were not advise what the tip amount was and that it was taken from our points.  No paper work indicated this.  Not knowing this it cost us an additional $10.00 to hand tip.  My main reason for going to the buffet was to eat crab. the 90 minute was not enough due to the time it takes to eat crab.  The desserts were great. but had to shove them down due to the time limit.  Another 15 minutes would have done it,3,4,3,1,September 25 2024
First I want to mention. we are local and my wife is handicapped and can't walk very fast or far.       When paying for the buffet. the checker never mentioned that a tip would be taken out of my rewards account. I only found out when I finished playing in the casino and checked my rewards account. I should have been told.      The one and half hour rule should be TWO HOURS as the cash receipt is when the time starts. So walking to assigned table. quick walk to see what is being served. standing on line for food and time back and forth to the table takes away from eating time.  Also the wife and I didn't have much conversation while there due to time constraints.      When getting up for desert. I noticed some tables next to us where not cleared. When I returned neither was ours. I had to pile the used dishes to the corner to make room for our desert dish(no server around). Apparently the server does not clean at this point as we had to look at piled used dishes.       When we got up to leave. about 1 minute beyond time by my watch. the server was right there to set the table for the next guests. I didn't want any discussions as other reviewer's had.      I handed the server a cash tip(not knowing some tip was already awarded) and she never acknologed it. just kept cleaning.      Would I/we be back???,4,5,4,5,September 25 2024
Quick and time preference was awesome Hot crab available on mid week  thx,5,5,5,4,September 25 2024
too much. too expensive for what they give you in return. from my point of view it is an abuse. on social networks they indicate a price and when you are there it turns out that it is much more expensive.,1,3,2,3,September 25 2024
Over priced but good experience.  You can get the quality of food at a much cheaper price at other places. Experience was cool but will never go back.,3,4,4,4,September 25 2024
Overpriced. poor quality food and service none existent.  Seafood flavourless and watery - not great.,3,3,2,2,September 25 2024
Huge selection of food but the hot lobster was out too long and my friend couldn't eat his shrimp because it was too slimy,5,4,5,5,September 25 2024
Tasteless . we expected something better than the Wynn,1,1,5,3,September 24 2024
Outstanding food tons and tons of options. should add more cakes or brownies however,5,5,5,5,September 24 2024
First the deserts were outstanding.  The seafood was fresh however very bland and for whatever the crab legs were water soaked.  My wife tried the prime rib and it was overcooked.  In all fairness it’s been 10-15 years since I’ve eaten at buffet.  I suspect just having to cook in huge quantities is what drove the majority of the quality problems.  Overall if you are big eater and like buffets I would definitely recommend they truly had something for every palate.,3,2,2,2,September 24 2024
It was my birthday dinner and it was fabulous. Everything was fresh and delicious.,5,5,5,5,September 24 2024
Sushi is very good. We will back to the Bacchanal Buffet.,5,5,5,5,September 24 2024
Sat down at 2:50pm on a Monday. ordered drinks and asked for crab cracker. waited 20 min. still no crab cracker. It wasn’t busy. server’s attitude was not nice… food quality not as good as used to be.,4,4,3,4,September 23 2024
Food not good. not worth the price. Will not come back,1,1,4,1,September 23 2024
Very overrated for the price. The only decent item is the crab legs. Everything else was dried out or cheap items you see on any regular buffet,2,1,2,2,September 23 2024
Our server was great and attentive. Some of the food was cold. My family and I enjoyed the crab legs. BBQ. and the crepe. pasta and noodle stations.,4,4,4,5,September 23 2024
Had reservations for four last weekend Dinner buffet and honestly was not impressed. I’ve been going to Vegas for many years and going to this buffet for many years as well. Food quality has gone down a lot most of the items that we ate were either cold or bland. Carving station Brisket was mostly fatty. For the cost of the buffet. there are much better buffets to go to in Vegas. We spent $460 At that price point look for a better buffet. This buffet is all hype now regret going.,2,2,4,4,September 23 2024
Enjoyed the food. the service and people were great. Did not like that I had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation. Overall an awesome experience due to our waiter and food.,5,5,3,5,September 23 2024
Seafood. especially the lobster was dry and did not taste right. Overpriced overall.,3,2,2,3,September 23 2024
The food was delicious...my waitress was outstanding. But one of the managers I asked a question to see if I could be moved to a closer table due to my husband suffers from mild dementia and has trouble getting around. He didn't let me finish asking the question before he cut me off and said all tables are reserved and rushed off.  Verry poor customer service a gentleman in a black suit that had no hair.... Managers lead thru example and his lack of customer service does no set a good example for the rest.,4,4,4,4,September 23 2024
I have been coming to Vegas for many years and the Baccanal buffet was a staple for me and my family to visit. This past visit though has changed my opinion of the restaurant. Quality is WAY down food choices aren’t what they used to be. Most items were COLD and the carving meats fatty and bland. For a group of four we paid $400+! Will be taking our business elsewhere plenty of buffets in Vegas that are much better and at a better price point.,1,1,1,1,September 23 2024
First of all. we felt very rushed to get in and out.  Seafood:  Presentation is nice. but quality was sub par.  Meats:  ham was great but mixed opinions on prime rib (mine was too tough to chew and others didn’t find it to be rare enough).  Desserts were the highlight of meal.  Server was slow to respond to our needs.  Overall. disappointed.  We found it to be overrated.,2,3,2,3,September 23 2024
it was good food- just seafood was a little over frozen( some lobsters claws. and shrimps and crawfish wasn't fresh in Louisiana stew) Overall- great selection. clean. plenty time to enjoy.,4,4,4,4,September 23 2024
My husband had been here before and kept raving about it. It was very good. however. I'm not sure that it is bigger or better than the buffet at the Wynn which is where we normally go. If you like seafood. Bacchanal definitely edges out the Wynn buffet. but coming from Florida. I don't mess with it (literally because of the mess) when I'm in Vegas. Again. both are excellent!,5,5,5,5,September 23 2024
"Has gone way down hill - used to be top tier quality. but now is just ""meh"" for most options.  For a buffet like this to be worth it. it has to be quite good at a handful of things - but the Bacchanal is now just mid-tier at all of them.  Take your money and spend it on 2 other smaller buffets instead for more variety or if you care about quantity over quality. or just 1 actual good meal.  Here you will just feel hurried for 90 minutes and be more and more disappointed throughout the meal.",2,2,3,2,September 23 2024
Un buen lugar para festejar con una comida riquísima. Encuentras variedad de platillos de muchos países. De lo que comimos todo estuvo exquisito.   En esta ocacion nosotros festejamos el cumpleaños de mi hija. pero cabe mencionar que no hubo nada alusivo al cumpleaños por parte del lugar apensar de que lo preguntan a la hora de hacer la reservacion.  Sin embargo es una experiencia fantástica y la comida riquísima.,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
The amount of food was impressive. but nothing was great... just OK. Example... the shrimp were soft and mushy and certain items were over cooked and had no taste. This place is definitely about quantity over quality. But in Vegas where Drinks are $30+ and a slice of avg pizza is $10 ($57 for the whole pizza at the Flamingo food court). the $85 per person cost seemed like a bargain!,4,3,5,4,September 22 2024
Muy variado y sabroso  la atención es muy buena. lo recomiendo,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
Not worth dollar   Don’t waste your money   Think design for tourist and the Cesar name If into name dropping go there,1,3,1,1,September 22 2024
I was disappointed as this was similar to a loud cafeteria. The check in process even though we had a reservation was like a train station. The quality of the food was good. the ambiance was totally missing.,3,4,4,1,September 22 2024
The options were expansive!!!! The brisket from the meat cutting station was incredible! My personal favorite were the made to order crepes; bananas foster for the win!!! Delicious.,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
Food wise. I cannot complain.  Their assortment is phenomenal.  They have dishes to accommodate different cultures and they were exquisite.  My only complaint is that they give you 90 minutes to eat. but we were not told.  Being on a girls trip. we sat and chatted without minding the time.  Not knowing the time limitations. three different managers came to run us off.  They were extremely rude.  No one tells you you have a certain amount of time.  It made us feel very uncomfortable.  As if we were doing something wrong.  We paid around $100 per person for the buffet and felt somewhat abused by the harassment.  My suggestion to them is to put signs when you pay about the 90 minutes.  The meal was not cheap and we deserved to be treated with respect.,3,5,1,4,September 22 2024
Now this was a buffet! Good food quality and service,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
This buffet is absolutely amazing!! My family ate here twice the weekend we visited. You will not be disappointed with this buffet!!,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
The server never refilled the drinks and just wasn't very attentive.,2,1,1,3,September 22 2024
We frequent this buffet however this time was a disaster . Food tasted cold & old .,3,3,4,3,September 22 2024
I had lamb (dry) beef (tough) dessert = delicious. Value? NOT worth the money.,3,2,4,1,September 22 2024
This is by far the best buffet in Las Vegas! Literally everything I tasted was amazing. This will  be a permanent stop every year for sure!!,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
Great place to eat lots of different food . Noise level is high but with so many people that’s a given .,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
Great variety. awesome food. A litte bit on the pricier side. though,5,5,5,4,September 21 2024
This buffet is the best buffet they have in Vegas. and I've been to quite a bit of them. Definitely go. you won't be disappointed. Every time I go to Vegas I have to come here. It is pricey. but it's worth it!,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
Here’s the deal. I haven’t been to a Vegas buffet in probably 20 ish years and my expectations were level set before going. That said. give me a break with the PR about this being the best buffet in Las Vegas. It’s a C at best. For real not being mean. It’s just meh all around and honestly kind of not that great.,3,3,5,3,September 21 2024
It's best to book through Open Table where you'll bypass the regular line. Excellent service and food options are amazing. Have your Ceasar's players card ready when you pay.,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
Not a great experience.  Had a reservation and was in line prior to my seating time. Stood in a queue for 45 minutes before being seated and then was issued a stern warning we had to be done in 90 min. Lines were long. food was mostly cold.  Plates weren’t cleared in between servings and just sat piled up dirty on an otherwise small table. Was only offered my first drink re-fill at the end of the meal.  Never offered nor could secure any claw crackers for the crab legs.  Booked this for a special occasion and thoroughly disappointed I did. Environment uninspiring compared to Bellagio. Paris and others.  Felt like I was in a low end school cafeteria.,3,2,1,1,September 21 2024
My experience was amazing the food was great and seasoned to perfection. 10/10 will be back again,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
A 1.5 hour time limit makes this buffet unenjoyable. Didn’t really get to try all the foods I wanted as I felt rushed. Lack of hospitality. I didn’t like the flow of the buffet. Not well designed. I would rather be at the Wynn.,2,3,2,2,September 21 2024
The food was delicious I enjoyed everything I recommend it,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
Service is not what we expected. All they do is pickup the dishes and expect us to pay 20%. I ask for a pitcher of mimosa and it never came. The dishes after eating stayed on the table. Lack tentative. I should heve not given a tip prior to sitting down. After my experience I would have given a less tip.,4,4,3,5,September 21 2024
Food was delicious and with a great variety. It's a great place for seafood lovers.  If you are just a light eater. buffet it's not the plan.  The staff was professional and friendly.  Totally recommend if you want to experience the buffet style.,4,5,4,4,September 21 2024
The selection at this buffet was exceptional. everything was nicely laid out and easily accessible. The crab legs were very fresh and succulent. amongst everything else. There was a large dessert selection. the Oreo Tiramisu was my favorite. Will go again!,5,5,5,4,September 21 2024
On my birthday I just wanted a nice dinner. The menu options looked nice. and I thought this would be a much more pleasant experience. We left disappointed. the cost does not reflect the caliber of the food quality…. The food was bland. and I got sick within 30 minutes of eating here. I think it was the temperature of the seafood. When I shared my concerns I wasn’t met with kindness or understanding. My birthday was ruined and I would like to kindly request a refund. Unfortunately my experience has lead me to find it necessary to share my experience in a review and you can expect to see it on Google once I return home.,1,1,1,1,September 21 2024
Un des meilleurs buffet sur LAS VEGAS STRIP Du service au entrée plats et dessert Nous venons à chaque passage sur VEGAS Nous recommandons fortement se buffet pour tous ceux qui sont de passage à Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
Nothing was really great! The desert area was the best part. There are lots of choices on the buffet but unfortunately nothing was worth going back seconds. Lots of better choices for the price point.,2,2,3,3,September 21 2024
Great place and great value.  Crab legs are awesome!  The meat selections are great and you get to try foods from around the world.  Deserts are very good as well.  Highly recommend.,5,5,4,4,September 21 2024
Food was okay I expected better for the price! Prime rib was over cooked they had no rare pieces very disappointing,4,3,3,4,September 21 2024
The place and the variety of food is amazing. We have been able to go once a month and we still impress with a good quality of food and also the service,5,5,4,5,September 21 2024
The food was fantastic. The seafood. prime rib. lamb were all comparable to high end nonbuffet restaurants. It was interesting to have everything in one place.   It was a crowded when we went and drink refills and table clearing was a little lacking.,5,5,4,3,September 21 2024
Bacchanal always never ceases to impress. A great array of food. all prepared well. Left very satisfied and would go back again. Highly recommend making a reservation though. even with a reservation we had to wait but the wait was within reason given the popularity of the location. Without a reservation you should expect a longer wait time. upwards of an hour. if not longer. depending on the size of your party. I will say that it is an experience that is worth the wait.,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
2 people for an evening buffet will cost around 200 dollars. While thier options were plentiful and the presentation was good the quality was absolutely subpar. The food was old. quality and taste was horrible.For 200 dollars. literally almost any other restaurant would be better.,2,1,3,3,September 20 2024
For the price we paid for. it was not worth it. The lobster claw was not fresh. The other food selections were mediocre at taste. I would rather go to Palms Buffet and get the AYCE lobster at a decent price. Service was on rotation and they time you when come in. 90 mins is the allowed time to be there. Felt rushed. This will be our first and last visit to this buffet.,2,3,2,3,September 20 2024
"Just not what it used to be.Brisket and the prime rib were tough.The side dishes had no flavor.Not much seasoning on the ""Oriental"" selections.Shrimp and crab legs were just OK.Desserts were fair but not outstanding",3,2,3,4,September 20 2024
Food was excellent with lots of variety and excellent service as well!,5,5,5,4,September 20 2024
Excelente todo. pero si o si hay que reservar es la única recomendación,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
I feel it was overrated. It felt like a golden corral but with seafood. Seating was very old and outdated. You have to be there five minutes before reservation but didn't sit down until 30 minutes after reservation. They had a large selection of different foods but nothing was amazing. For being listed as the top buffet I thought it would be better.,3,3,3,1,September 20 2024
We had such a great waiter who made sure our plates were taken away quickly and kept our beverages filled and food was excellent,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
Definitely a must when in Las Vegas. Delicious  food. tad pricey but worth it.,5,5,3,4,September 20 2024
Disappointed   Thought Caesar would do better   Food was not up to par for such an establishment,2,2,1,1,September 20 2024
We always enjoy going here.   I believe it is the best buffet around.,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Besides the lady that kept blowing her nose next to us everything was great,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
All the food was very good and the service was excellent have been there serveral times and will be back,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Food was amazing.  Wish I could’ve eaten more!!!!!,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Not worth the price of $184 for two people as at September 2024. Food was nothing special and it was busy. so you are watching your watch to make sure you do not overstay your 90 min allotted time.,2,3,4,3,September 19 2024
This is definitely one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. Everything was amazing except the price.,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
The Restaurant is amazing. but i miss king crab legs.,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
Don't know how this Bacchanal buffet has been rated so high. most of the food has been sitting for sometime not very fresh at all & the marinade & seasoning isn't very good . I do not recommend & will never go back again. first & last time going to Bacchannal Buffet.,1,1,1,1,September 18 2024
Although we thought it was a little pricey. The quality of the food is outstanding. The selection is so big you will wanna sleep after this meal lol. We are already planning our 2nd Visit back to Vegas & will def be visiting here again,5,5,4,4,September 18 2024
The food was phenomenal. Everything I tasted was so good. The variety of food was awesome. My favorite part was the crab legs & the birria tacos.,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
Many options. Delicious choices. Friendly service. Definitely a must go to option.,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
Best Buffet in Las Vegas. Massive selection and great quality of food. Just be sure to make reservations.,5,5,3,5,September 17 2024
Expansive selection but some items dried up and held out too long.,5,5,5,4,September 17 2024
I think this is Absolutely The Best buffet ever!! Price is on point,5,5,5,5,September 17 2024
Overall a rushed experience.  Surrounding tables not cleared promptly and generally the crown focus on getting as much value as possible.. especially re the crab legs..,3,5,2,3,September 17 2024
Food was good. very expensive($80pp for dinner). Lots of rude people acting like they haven’t eaten in weeks. No salad bar area. which we thought was weird.,4,4,4,2,September 17 2024
You better come hungry and enjoy all the good food.,4,4,4,4,September 16 2024
Quality buffet. all food items were fresh and tasty. Excellent service from the servers and kitchens.,5,5,5,5,September 16 2024
The staff are friendly and informative. The food is great for its price.,5,5,5,5,September 16 2024
My husband and I enjoyed the buffet very much. There was a HUGE selection of food to choose from. The meat section was divine and the prime rib and brisket were cooked to perfection. So many choices from around the world. I loved the small portions so that if I didn't like something I was not wasting a normal portion. Our waiter was professional and nice. I did get up and asked him for refills on our drinks. I did not mind because he was extremely busy. it wasn't as if he was standing around not paying attention. The crab legs were hot and delicious. We loved trying food we would not normally order. The only negative comment I have is the dessert section. I was waiting at the Crepe section and two workers who were talking( socially) looked at me and then would look away ( all the other workers were working ). After a few minutes a manager walked by. I approached him and explained my situation. He apologized and I was immediately helped.,5,4,4,4,September 16 2024
Selection of food was good. Seafood was fresh. Dessert variety was good. The meats were juicy and tender if you get it as soon as it comes out otherwise it becomes a bit dry and overdone under the warmer. Overall experience was good not fantastic as described in reviews in our research. I don’t think it’s worth the money and especially they only give 90 minutes time limit!,4,4,5,5,September 16 2024
Great i loved it i will come again nex time i come to las vegas,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
The food was delicious and exceeded our expectations. We were hesitant it would not live up to our last visit but we were wrong. it surpassed it.,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Muy rico y variado. Totalmente recomendado!!! No olviden hacer reserva!!,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Gran variedad de alimentos. de muy buen sabor el servicio muy bueno todo estuvo excelente,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Make reservations as soon as you get there. Everything  was excellent.,5,5,5,4,September 15 2024
Lots of choices for everyone! Very busy at lunch time.,4,4,3,3,September 15 2024
Wedding party of 8 - good place to take a crowd that can’t agree. Some of them buffet goers mentioned it was the best they’ve been too.,5,4,5,4,September 15 2024
Large variation of food. everything was delicious! If you’re in Vegas and looking for a top quality buffet. this is the place.,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Even though we had reservations. we still had to wait￼ a good 30 mintes before getting seated. The food did not have the best flavor ￼ either and ￼ we also had to wait for certain foods because they  ￼ we’re out of the food,1,1,2,2,September 15 2024
Great meal and excellent service - go while in Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Very pretty buffet lots of options very good for price point and really good food!,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Always a pleasure eating here! Me and my wife always enjoy coming to Ceaser casino,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
For the money you spend. the service should have been better. We didn't get to eat because we made rsvp just to have to wait in two lines and not eat because they were about to close,1,1,1,1,September 15 2024
Awesome!  Great food and atmosphere. Best buffet in vegas,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
It is pretty expensive but there is a variety of different foods you can choose.,5,3,4,4,September 15 2024
We eat out most of the time. This was the worst meal I believe haive ever had to suffer through. We went to a burger place at another hotel right after. No pride - so many items so far over cooked around 7 pm. It was so ridiculous! Table was not being cleaned. Table was packed with dishes. Most of the dishes had the way overcook meals.,1,1,4,5,September 15 2024
Overall it was a great experience!  Only drawback was the air conditioning...it was a bit too cold,5,5,5,5,September 15 2024
Experience was horrible! Long wait even though had a reservation! Some of the food was cold! I hate to complaint since I work for the hospitality industry but this time I have to. I had a party of 6 ppl who were visiting from outside the USA and I really wanted to surprise them with the buffet but this time we were all disappointed. I’m sorry to say it but it was the worst experience ever! I don’t think I want to come back.,1,3,2,2,September 15 2024
Seafood such as shrimps. crawfish etc. were not fresh.  Meat seems like from yesterday.   Desserts were okay. Prize - expensive. other buffet are more cheaper and good and fresh food.,1,1,3,3,September 15 2024
Terrible service but the crab was so good it barely mattered,5,5,1,4,September 14 2024
Food was great! First time coming to Vegas and the Buffet has different cultural foods!,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
My experience was nice. I will definitely come back.,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
Honestly everything I ate was DELICIOUS! I will go back every time I go to Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
I recently dined at Bacchanal Buffet. and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish! The variety and quality of the food were outstanding. with every dish tasting fresh and flavorful. From the delicious seafood to the savory meats and endless dessert options. there was something for everyone.  A special shoutout to our waiter. Michael. who went above and beyond to make our experience even more enjoyable. He was attentive. friendly. and ensured our drinks were always topped off. His excellent service truly elevated our visit.  I can't recommend this buffet enough—amazing food and stellar service. Five stars!,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
The food was great. The waitress unfortunately could have been better. We had to keep looking around for her and had someone else refill our drinks. We didn’t even see her once we were leaving.,5,5,3,5,September 14 2024
very crowded. like everything in Vegas. but the line moved fast and the services was great.  Definitely recommended,5,5,5,3,September 14 2024
We were very. very underwhelmed by the food. Buffet Presentation was absolutely great. service was great. variety of food was great but the food just wasn’t unfortunately. We ate at the Bellagio buffet three months earlier. and it’s far and away better food.,3,2,5,3,September 14 2024
The buffet was amazing the food options and taste of all the food was fantastic!!,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
Good but pricey and loud…. classic vegas buffet i suppose.,4,5,3,3,September 14 2024
They definitely went for quantity over quality here. Lots of options but nothing was really all that good (including the desserts). Service was great. the staff works hard.,2,1,4,4,September 14 2024
Food was pretty solid. Lots of chilled seafood-- shrimp. crab and lobster.,4,4,3,4,September 14 2024
La comida no esta deliciosa. las mesas están muy sucias. los meseros no recogen los platos sucios. No vale el precio que cobran por la calidad de la comida. La carne muy mala.,3,2,4,5,September 14 2024
We were welcomed to the system by having to join a lengthy queue despite having already made reservation. Whilst queueing we had to pay in advance and also tip for service before having received any service. The irony of tipping for service in what is essentially a self service restaurant was noted. Food was OK and beef was good. Seafood tended to be cheaper items - no jumbo shrimp or lobster tail. We again had to tip for drinks service meaning as we understood it. the server was tipped twice. Very noisy and table clear down was slow in our area. Overall not a relaxing or enjoyable experience. with overall feeling that customers were herded through the system.,1,3,1,1,September 14 2024
Always love coming here every visit to Vegas. can’t wait to be back next month!,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
On 9/13/24. The hosts in the front were horrible. We had reservations at 6:30pm for a party of 6. Paid for our meal. and was moved to the line next the diamond lane (we were first in line with no one in the diamond lane or behind us) the minute we got there. we noticed all the hosts (older Hispanic folks) started giving us evil looks like we did something even though we were just in line waiting. We waited for approximately 25 mins and then another huge party came over with kids and babies. They were escorted by the cashier to the same lane as us. And moved to the diamond lane by themselves because they wanted to stand in a circle and talk. The host saw when they moved to the other lane and  We notice the host started giving us the looks again and then came and got the group that just got there. I asked them how come they get to go first and one of them answered “it’s because they have kids so they have priorities because the kids done consumed much food.” I said that’s the fair because we paid for our food too and it’s not like the parents are not going to use up the whole 90 mins as well. she gave me the most evil look and told her other employers to come and talk to me. I asked again and he said “it’s because they are diamond. but I told them they they clearly saw that the family was not diamond and saw them moved to that lane. He gave me an attitude and just left without even checking if the other party were diamond.   We were so upset that made our time there unpleasant. It was the worst experience I ever had. Probably will not come again or recommend people to come if they are just going to receive the same treatment we experienced that day. Those hosts were horrible with horrible attitudes.,2,3,1,2,September 14 2024
Lots of selection. Not as much seafood as I had hoped.,3,3,4,3,September 13 2024
This buffet was a little disappointing in that the price of nearly $100 was ridiculous for the value. The food was only mediocre. some was cold when it should have been. at the least. warm. It was very noisy and the chairs at the tables were worn and very dirty. The plus was excellent table service from the wait staff. I would not recommend the Bacchanal Buffett! The buffet at the Wynn is FAR superior…sorry Caesar’s.,3,2,5,2,September 13 2024
After making a reservation for 19:30. we arrived and had to wait an hour for a table. Didn’t like the fact you had to prepay for the buffet before eating. Very expensive. around $90 per person. Food was okay but felt for the price it would have been better going to a proper restaurant. Service was poor and very busy queuing for food.  Only allocated 1.5 hours per table before they throw you out. Just feel it wasn’t for us. not what I expected from centre of the Las Vegas Strip.,2,3,1,2,September 13 2024
always a great buffet. rated the best in las vegas. way too much food to pick from !!,5,5,5,5,September 13 2024
Wow awesome anything you can imagine on menu presentation quality quantity worth price,5,5,5,5,September 13 2024
Service was good. Our table was bussed frequently. The prime rib was better this time. Tender and flavorful. The Asian foods were as expected. The addition of a glassy noodle was a pleasant surprise. Very tasty. The lobster claws were tender sweet. Cutting the claws was helpful in getting the meat out.,4,4,5,4,September 13 2024
Although I liked how there were a lot of variety and possible accommodations for food. most of the food were mediocre with 2-3 exceptions at best. The foods usually tasted a little stale and/or barely warm (which probably meant that it was out for awhile). In addition. the buffet’s large dessert variety was a nice surprise since I thought it was going to be a small section. But. many of the desserts ended up being too sweet or somewhat stale that it was hard to finish most of them. From my and my group’s personal experience. the buffet’s price is definitely WAYYYY overpriced for the food quality you’re getting. However. something to mention is that the staffs were all very friendly. very attentive. very demure. Lol. 5 stars for service and staffs but if I were rate the buffet based on food and taste alone. it would be like 2.5 stars.,3,2,4,3,September 12 2024
Good experience. Good food. Excellent waitstaff. Just a little pricey if you ask me but overall good experience.,3,3,4,3,September 12 2024
Not what I expected food was ok but not great not worth the price at all,1,2,1,1,September 12 2024
Beautiful buffet the food was average. The Wynn buffet is much better!,3,2,5,5,September 12 2024
The food was really good. almost too much to experience in one visit. Given how busy it was. the service was also great.,5,5,5,4,September 12 2024
For having a reservation we still waited like 45min in line to pay and get seated… this is probably the most expensive buffet in Vegas the food availability and quality does not match the price.,3,4,3,3,September 12 2024
The food was great quality and very plentiful. The server was great and took care of all of us perfectly. This was my favorite meal and Vegas and I would definitely go back. The crab legs were to die for.,5,5,5,5,September 12 2024
My favorite buffet. The food is always consistent and the service is great.,5,4,5,4,September 12 2024
Profile:  Couple on vacation.  2nd time since 2022 to buffet.  Pros:  variety of food (seafood. beef. mexian. italian.  chinese. vegan) and that dessert bar; staff most accommodating  for diary free needs.  Cons:  Seafood was quite good; I felt the quality of the beef was not great (too fatty in many instances). everything else was good.  Value:  hard to stay and depends on how much you intake.  Cost if about $95 pp plus tax plus tip.  Tip:  Don't do the tip upfront.  Wait until you see how the service progresses and tip at the end.,4,4,3,3,September 11 2024
"Lobster was served cold and claws were precut to make them very dry. Same for crab. Burger sliders were dry. prime rib was tough. and not very tasty. Deserts were average. for the price. the food should have been a lot better. Sushi was not very appealing.  I tried a California roll. and spit it out. Also service was not professional.  I ordered a glass of merlot wine. to find a small worm and fruit flys in it. I brought it to the attention to the waitress.  she responded by saying ""it's only a fly"".  I'm from the USA. I do not eat bugs. Never again we will go to that buffet.  Nothing was good!!",1,1,1,1,September 11 2024
Seafood is great. Don’t miss the lobster.craft and shrimps. Desserts are awesome. Try the Mexican food they change it very often and it’s so good.,5,5,4,5,September 10 2024
Very clean and well stocked.  Very efficient.  Good Varieties.  Seafood stations were satisfactory.  Prime Ribs and Briskets were excellent.  Asian station were below average.,5,4,5,5,September 10 2024
Great food and service.  Great peine rib lobster  wonderful  variety. Anything you desire. Loved dessert bar too Would dine here again,5,5,5,5,September 10 2024
Honestly when you pay $190 for a dinner for 2 you expect to be eating somewhere that has great ambiance and it felt like we were eating in a ski resort cafeteria. Food was good but the service by one of the people that sat us left a bad taste in my mouth. We were seated and told to put our stuff down and go grab food. When we got back to our table it was seated with a different couple and our hostess was rude and stated that we cant seat there when we had been sat there less than 5 minutes ago. Not only that she sat us at a dirty table and made us carry all our plates. glasses and utensils ourselves to our dirty table. Will not be coming back.,2,3,1,1,September 10 2024
Too stingy with beef. It’s almost like the prime rib guy didn’t like me specifically. Guys in front of me and after me got nice big. thick portions of beautiful rare beef. then he cuts me a tiny piece off of a well done end. Awful. I couldn’t even eat it. Next time I tried the other line with a different guy. he gives me a deli-sandwich ultra thin slice… Come on. I paid $90 for this???? The service was terrible. no waitress for the first 30 minutes. Everyone we asked said they weren’t our server but they’d tell ours we needed them. Finally got a server and got some drinks. Then she seemed to totally forget we were her table. I think we’ll try the buffet at the Wynn next time.,2,3,1,3,September 10 2024
A Buffet worthy for Kings .Excellent! A variety of dishes from different cultures.,5,4,4,4,September 9 2024
Needs better cooked options on steaks and seafood,3,3,4,3,September 9 2024
Prime rib was the best ever!  Crab legs were also good.  Service was great.,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
We went for the crab and it was good. Other Asian dishes I had were also good but found the desserts manufactured plastic morsels. Did not enjoy. We were up the back room so was ok outlook. I am short and found the table very high.,3,3,4,3,September 9 2024
This has been highlighted as one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. I will agree. it was quite good. however. I think it was a bit overpriced. Yes. it did include crab and lobster. The lobster claws were dry and old and had no flavor. I don’t think I’ve ever had lobster that was this unappetizing. Overall. the crab legs were pretty good although there were some of them that were “soggy “.  The also included a vast selection of other items and the dessert section was pretty good. When I go again? With that heavy price tag per person. I’m going to say probably not. Like I said. it was really good. but I just don’t think it was worth the amount per person.,4,4,5,5,September 9 2024
The food and service was fabulous as always however our entire party are all diamond plus Caesar’s rewards and we made a reservation in advance but we weren’t all able to sit together. They put us at 2 separate tables which was frustrating! We walked by at least 3 tables of 8 that were empty but they made us sit separately which was disheartening since we wanted to all be together.,4,5,5,3,September 9 2024
As usual. most of the food was fantastic. with very few exceptions. The one caveat is that I don't like the 90-minute time limit. While I understand it's to help with crowd turnover and allow more persons to dine. it felt rushed and didn't allow for a full true sampling of the variety of foods available. If a time limit is necessary. I'd suggest extending it to 2 to 2.5 hrs to allow for some digestion between plates and a better opportunity to sample more.,4,5,4,4,September 9 2024
Service was good. they took our plate right after we finish and drink was refill instantly.  Asian food was great. lots of variety of Asian food. from dim sum. sushi. filipino foods. to noodles. too stir fried.  the BBQ and seafood area was ok. prime rib was only cook one way. lamb not into. brisket was the only thing good. as for seafood. all but the crab legs were cool..Dessert was great. love the crepes and ice creams.  It isn’t worth the money paid for.  I ate at buffet that is a lot cheaper and is almost the same.  I think it’s just a big hype because it’s in Las Vegas.  Not even worth the experience..,3,4,4,3,September 9 2024
My family and I ate at Bacchanal on September 8th to celebrate my daughter’s  birthday. The two female hosts that were seating at the 545 shift were nothing but rude. No class. no customer service. and totally ruined the tone of our dinner.  The first host walked my husband and I to our table since my daughter was coming down from the room. We asked if we can sit next to the Asian section and she rudely replied with. “I cannot wait here! People have to be seated so you have to get out and wait in line again to tell the receptionist” even though we asked her to give us just a second to ask our daughter if she’s okay with that seat section. But she rushed us to get back in line so we did. When we were in line. the second female host totally disregarded us and told the party behind us to follow her when we were there before them. We asked if we will be seated too since they were going to the Asian section. the section we had originally wanted. She rolled her eyes and rudely replied. “go follow me” without any customer service! Once we were sat she said in an unpleasant manner. “you 90 mins here” like she was rushing us and pushing us out already. It was very rude and condescending. When we were passing by another table. she sat a white family and in the sweetest voice she said “you have 90 mins to dine!” and from there you can see the difference with how she treats the guests. Everytime we’re in Vegas we make it an effort to come dine here. You pay so much for not only the food. but customer service. This was by far the worst customer service experience we’ve experienced with all our time here in Bacchanal (and we come here often). From the two arrogant female hosts down to the lobster chef— they were all rude! Juan at the ice cream section and Nicole our server was the saving grace. Birthdays are special since we only celebrate it once a year and those two female hosts left a bad taste in our mouths. Honestly. you don’t deserve to pay that much amount for d rude svc,2,4,2,3,September 9 2024
I wanted to give the Bacchanal 5 stars. but Ceasars Palace charges for parking even though I paid $190 for two buffet dinners. With parking & tip. two buffet dinners cost closer to $250. Other than the parking fee. I loved everything about the Bacchanal buffet.  Fyi. Wynn gives you 3 hours of free parking. Their buffet is pretty good too.,4,5,5,4,September 9 2024
"A wide assortment of generally well-prepared food is the Bacchanal Buffet's strength.  The crab legs. rib roast (the carver had no ""rare"" slices). and salads were all good.  The lamb chops were great; but the limited selection of sushi (no sashimi) was just OK--about what you would get at a Chinese restaurant buffet.  I was disappointed in the quality and lack of variety of the dessert choices.  There were hand-scooped ice cream options and sherbet; gelatin-based desserts. flan. and cookies; but no cakes or pies.  While I would consider returning. I think first I'll try some other buffets.",4,4,5,3,September 8 2024
Great food. Salads. crab legs. meat. fish you have everything.. plus excellent desserts,5,5,5,5,September 8 2024
The Bacchanal is an overpriced buffet and an interesting dining experience in bland food. The meat dishes are uninspired. the seafood is a tad waterlogged. and the desserts lack finesse. It is not a foodie experience. but it is still an experience just the same.,2,2,3,2,September 8 2024
The hype is real! I was only in Vegas for 1.5 days and I chose this buffet after some light research. Compared to the other meals I ate. this was the best bang for buck. Fresh food. great flavor! I went for breakfast and made reservations and everything was smooth!,5,5,5,5,September 8 2024
Had to wait almost an hour even tho we had reservations  The food was just ok for way overpriced  Amount,3,3,2,2,September 8 2024
Price was high as compared to to WYNN according to food quality and variety they have.,3,3,3,2,September 8 2024
The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas is often praised for its variety and quality. but as with any popular venue. opinions can vary. Here’s a fair overview based on general feedback:  **Pros:** 1. **Variety:** Bacchanal offers an extensive range of dishes from around the world. From seafood and prime rib to sushi and an array of international cuisines. there’s something for everyone. apart from my wife. as there was no noodle at the asian buffet  2. **Quality:** Many guests appreciate the freshness and quality of the food. The buffet is known for its high standards. with attention to detail in presentation and taste. 3. **Ambiance:** The setting is upscale and spacious. making for a pleasant dining experience. The modern design and clean layout contribute to a comfortable atmosphere.  **Cons:** 1. **Price:** Bacchanal is on the pricier side. and while many feel it’s worth the cost given the variety and quality. it may be considered expensive for those on a budget. 2. **Crowds:** Due to its popularity. the buffet can be quite busy. which might lead to longer wait times or a less intimate dining experience. 3. **Consistency:** Some reviewers mention that while the overall experience is good. there can be occasional lapses in service or food quality. which may vary depending on the day or time.  Overall. the Bacchanal Buffet is often recommended for its impressive selection and high-quality dishes. though it’s worth considering the price and potential for crowds when planning your visit.,5,4,3,4,September 8 2024
The food was excellent and plentiful. Unfortunately trying to get a drink refill took about 15 minutes and having to get a busser to get our server.,4,5,3,4,September 8 2024
All the best in every way great experience and great food,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
Very good quality on seafood and other options will be returning again.,4,4,4,4,September 7 2024
Check was easy and the selection was massive. Loved it! Willl definitely be back,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
My third time eating at the Bacchanal Buffet and it never disappoints. Very good food and of course excellent crab legs. I personally believe it’s worth what you pay for.,5,5,4,4,September 7 2024
Poor experience. The food was cold and not very tasteful. They serve dishes individually to cover the fact that everything is mass produced from low quality ingredients. The place smelled like 2-day old crab. but to be fair. I’m not a sea food fan. Prime rib was cold and fatty. Price was way too expensive- $200+ for breakfast. Gelato was best dish of the day. Wish I would have ordered UberEats from a local breakfast restaurant instead - probably would have cost half as much.,1,1,4,1,September 7 2024
Firstly this is the most expensive buffet in Las Vegas at approx 50% higher than the next most expensive. So you go in expecting the best. We were greeted at the front and sent to the kiosk to pay prior to entry to the buffet. Standard process for any Buffet. But when paying I was told to either tip here only card or with cash after we eat. I don’t like being told I have to tip. Not really the vibe I’m looking for from the most expensive buffet in town. Anyway. now I’m told I need to tip I’m expecting the highest level of service. A waiter greats is at the table with a ‘what do you want to drink’… am I at Denny’s? What’s going on here?? We ask for a cappuccino. ‘sorry we don’t do those. black coffee only’. Ok… and a ginger ale please. ‘sprite. coke. Mountain Dew…. No ginger ale’.  Again… this is the most expensive buffet in Vegas!! Bellagio offers a pour your own soda fountain with more choices than you can imagine. Wynn would die not to get you a cappuccino etc etc Anyway… we get past this and are ready to explore the food options! Great variety. 10 kitchens I think. Seafood options are good. mussels amazing snow crab solid. Chinese food is good. frog legs the star. But then everything else is just a mediocre to terrible version of what a dish is meant to be like. Staff are all miserable too which doesn’t help. I’m meant to be in the most expensive Buffet in Vegas here and yet I’d rather be at the Golden Corral. Seriously… don’t bother. Go to the Wynn or Bellagio for a much more fun and better quality buffet experience. There’s even a great Indian buffet at Mint for 18.99 at lunch which is a little out the way off the strip. but a million times better. Or don’t. and regret going to this buffet…,2,2,1,2,September 7 2024
Superb selections and service. Too complicated check in process for first timers,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
The food was a total waste of money and if there was an option for zero stars I would definitely give it. The warm crab legs were hoarded while they literally forced you to take the ice cold crab legs. I definitely won’t go back there,1,1,1,2,September 7 2024
Not as much food as last time more variety more experiences,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
Definitely not worth the price of admission. The food was average. I should have gone to a Brazilian Steakhouse buffet instead,2,2,3,2,September 7 2024
There have been a lot of changes in food prep and service and not for the better. They are just leaning on the past and do not seem to concerned about the present quality. This will be my final visit to the Bacchanal Buffet. Food quality has declined dramatically the crab legs were soft and mushy. lobster claws were very rubbery. Service was fine. all the employees were friendly. This was not the experience I wanted for my 64th Birthday.,4,2,4,3,September 7 2024
Great beside the price. Price could be cheaper and more selection,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
Overall a fantastic dining experience. The food was good and there is way more than you could ever imagine. Cost was quite high but the variety of seafood and hand carved meats was spectacular. Lamb. beef. pork. and even duck. Also quite and exquisite display of Italian. Greek. and Asian dishes. Now the desert bar had so many choices you could visit here and never have the same thing twice for a month. Thanks for a great evening.,4,4,5,5,September 6 2024
Very expensive the quality of food is not the best for a buffet,1,2,1,1,September 6 2024
It's great ande delicious  and I got so full that I had indigestion,3,3,3,3,September 6 2024
had a large group party. with 3 reservations. they were able to sit us all together. We were there on Saturday at 12 noon and the manager was AMAZING and made sure our visit was great. I cannot recall his name.,5,5,4,5,September 6 2024
the best buffet in Vegas.  I know there is an argument between the Wynn. Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal.  I have been to all 3 within the past 12 months and Bacchanal is the best.   For those that argue the others. what do they have that Bacchanal doesn't?    I go here every time i visit Vegas which is usually 3-4 times a year.  The Price is a bit high. but i usually get it free with my Caesar's rewards points.,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
Great food and a lot! It was expensive because of all you can eat crab legs but they were awesome,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
Had a 7.30 booking but didn't get seated till 8pm due to large queues resembling customs at an airport not a fine dining experience. Some of the quality of the food especially meats was below what we expected tough beef dry chicken.all food was not hot. Didn't like having to pay before being seated,2,2,3,1,September 6 2024
85$ per person is a little bit excessive Lister claw was not fresh. weird texture Dish in other type of cuisine beside seafood was just okay nothing outstanding.,3,3,5,4,September 6 2024
We always go when we are in Las Vegas. The food is awesome. You can’t go wrong everything from prime rib to crab legs. and lobster to Mexican to Asian. I always love the crème brûlée and the warm cinnamon roll dessert!,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
Everything was excellent! 90 minutes is a bit tight. but overall. i would recommend!,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
The Bacchanal Buffet is an amazing food display. Everything is delicious. With lots of choices in different categories. The only complaint would be the price of the overall experience.,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
￼I usually try to hit this buffet when I’m in town. I usually fast for day before so I can enjoy it and it’s been great every time. like  everything else the price went up now it’s $93 dollars. they also tried to add a $17 tip which I usually don’t tip unless I get it service wasn’t happy with that. So I usually go to only 2 stations. Het meat and seafood (high protein) In the seafood section the hot crab was cold and they had some warm day and rubbery lobster claws.(these were so bad) Off to the meat station. The lamb was cold. bone marrow was cold nothing was hot at all. Overall my first round was very disappointed. I went back from crab and it was at least warm this time. I will say the prime rib was warm and tasty like usual . I did not enjoy the brisket or the tri-tip. they also did not have beef ribs this time which I do enjoy. I usually just stay in these two sections but was disappointed so I tried other things mini gyro was just ok. Sushi was just ok the wasabi and soy sauce were in small packages. I felt very cheap and underwhelming. The dessert bar was the best thing of my meal. The best thing by far was the hot cinnamon roll. I think that was actually what I enjoyed the most for 93 bucks! Next time I’m in Vegas. I’m gonna pass the buffet.,3,3,3,5,September 5 2024
Best buffet in Vegas…Must have if you’ve never been here before. From the seafood selection to dessert section. everything is delicious!,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
The meat selection and crab offering was the highlight of the dining experience.  When I came the seafood station. Asian and Italian foods were a little bit lacking. The sushi was only rolls. no Nigiri or Sashimi. The Chinese selection was somewhat standard American fare. Italian was some thick doughed pizza and meatballs.  I'm happy I finally tried the buffet but it was a little overhyped.   I do think it was worth the value to go.,4,4,3,3,September 5 2024
Food was cold at the buffet. Cold prime rib. Asian station etc. We ordered 4 drinks and 2 were good. 2 were not but the manager was generous enough take the 2 bad drinks off the bill. The quality was not what it used to be.,2,1,4,4,September 5 2024
Amazing food and service. Would highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
So many dishes to choose from and all were very good. Desserts were abundant and tasty. Make sure you are hungry when you arrive. Fish lovers will be very happy!,5,5,4,4,September 5 2024
The food was very delicious and the variety/options of food was great. However the service was extremely poor. We had made reservations and yet we still had to wait in line to be seated. Furthermore. we were several couples that were `collected´ by the waiter and randomly escorted through the restaurant. scouting for a place to sit. This made the whole scenario seem very cheap and low quality. Our service waiter was also extremely rude - once we were finally seated. our waiter quickly muttered the choices of drink and seemed agitated with our difficulty in understanding her. Once my fiancé had ordered a coke. I politely asked if they had Doc. Pepper and she said no and walked away without asking whether she could get me another drink instead. Also. she never supplied us with a seafood cracker/claw (making dining on their seafood selection impossible) even though we asked for it five times. Generally we seemed like an annoyance and inconvenience to her and the general atmosphere of the seating area was the likes of a Golden Coral.  Taking the price of this buffet into account (quite expensive). the service was horrible and to be honest I do not think that the food makes up for the poor atmosphere and service level.,1,4,1,1,September 5 2024
This is one of the first times we’ve been and been disappointed. The service was amazing. But the food felt like it had been out all day.  Too expensive of an experience for that to happen,3,3,5,4,September 5 2024
The best Buffet we have ever gone too! Our party of five enjoyed every piece of food that was on our plate!! The desert bar was fabulous. small portions of desert is the best way to serve. My birthday celebration on that day was “Delicious” thank you Caesars Palace!!,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
Great seafood. short rib risotto. desserts. charcuterie.,5,5,3,3,September 5 2024
The buffet was good but very expensive. The average person cannot eat enough to make it worth it. A once in a while is okay but not often.,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
Always great food. need to stop by at least once anytime I'm in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
Overpriced for the quality of food. They give it a fancy name. throw some garnish on it and hope you don't notice the lack of flavor or the poor temperature and quality. Hostesses and cashiers were rude before entering then the place asks if you'd like to tip before services are rendered. My advice ..skip it.,3,2,4,4,September 4 2024
90 minutes is such a short time: you should allow at least 120 minutes. The beverage price is far too high.,4,5,3,4,September 4 2024
I made a reservation and still waiting 2 hours. absolutely not recommended,1,1,1,1,September 4 2024
Phenomenal food and choices! Definitely will go again!,5,5,5,5,September 4 2024
The price is ridiculous the length of wait when you have reserved. Is shocking . The salad and fruit was pleasant the lack of potatoes and choice appalling for the price mash or mash and the vegetable yuk greasy beans or greasy peas and even greasy broccoli ???? You boil broccoli it should be crisp not greasy . Such a rip off and the poor staff look so fed up,2,2,5,2,September 4 2024
The price paid for six people. considering the quality of the food. was simply unacceptable. The lobster and crab lacked flavor. while the prime rib and brisket were overcooked and cold. All six of us agreed that the main attractions were far from impressive. so we opted for alternatives at the buffet. Unfortunately. most of those options were disappointing as well. Many items. like the meatballs and several of the Asian buns and shu mai. were cold.  During our 90-minute stay. only one of us received a single refill of tea. The remaining five people did not receive refills of their drinks or the water they had requested. We only saw our waiter twice: once when we were seated and again when the one cup of tea was refilled. After that. we didn’t see the waiter for the rest of our meal.  On a positive note. the Mexican food and desserts were great.  This was my third visit to the buffet. and it’s the first time I’ve had a bad experience. Unfortunately. for the other five people I was with. it was their first time. and it didn’t live up to expectations.  I enjoy dining at this establishment and usually make a reservation as soon as I arrive in Las Vegas. I plan to continue doing so. but sadly. the other five people with me stated that they do not want to return due to the poor quality of the food.,2,1,1,3,September 4 2024
We both got sick within an hour after eating   We had to wait an hour to get in with  have a gold card and was still charged FULL price,1,1,3,1,September 4 2024
Seafood is too salty. And crab legs are hard to peel.,4,3,5,5,September 4 2024
Incredible! Crab and prime rib were the best. Tons of options,5,5,5,5,September 4 2024
Food and experience was great. staff were incredible and the quality of the food was delicious,5,4,5,5,September 4 2024
Everyone we encountered had a bad attitude and seemed annoyed we were checking in or trying to order drinks. Our server was cold. we had to ask if we needed a refill and waited long times. very few drink options. food was good but with the service not Worth the price. We tried to let someone know our server was hard to find and ruined our whole experience but was rushed out the door and no one cared about what we had to say as they already had our money. Just save yourself the time and money and go to the wynn. Service and food were incredible.,2,3,1,1,September 4 2024
Food is average prime rib were good. Over priced In Houston that is first class restaurant.,2,2,3,2,September 4 2024
Excelente Muy rico y super recomendable Delicioso,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
If you love seafood. you’ll love this buffet.  We came for the dinner buffet.  I was there for the crab legs and the lobster claws.  I also had the muscles and clams and shrimp and was not at all disappointed. I love the fact that the lines to grab food were not too bad. the food was always fresh and always replenished.  Everything was very clean and our waitress kept our table clean and our drinks were always filled. The variety of food was also exceptional…there was something for every taste pallet. We will definitely be coming back again soon with more of our family and friends.  Just make sure that you make your reservations ahead.,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
It was fine. I felt like there should be more food choices. I wasn't impressed. The crab legs were not good. No flavor and very overcooked.,3,3,4,4,September 3 2024
Very loud. Servers was pretty bad for weekend. Wish they had better service.,1,1,1,1,September 3 2024
Still my favorite buffet in Vegas. the staff is always friendly and accomedating. I'm in a wheelchair and was pleasantly surprised how they all did so much to ensure i had access to everything. thank you to Mr Laipple and his wonderful staff.,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
Food selection was great. Great atmosphere. Employees were very accommodating and service was excellent. Clean. Great place to eat.,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
Long wait after having reservations no water refills food was excellent though,5,5,1,5,September 3 2024
They didn’t honor our open table wait list. we waited in  line with people who just walked up. This did nothing for us but sign myself up to bombarded spam emails and text.,5,5,5,4,September 3 2024
We always go to Caesar’s Bucchanal Buffet when visiting Vegas (at least 4-5x a year). The variety is incredible and the food is better quality than the other buffets we’ve visited (Wynn. Cosmo. Main Street. Palms).,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
We arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes earlier than our reservation time. The restaurant told us they couldn't find our reservation and turned us down a bit rudely. However. 30 minutes later. the app showed that we were dining in this restaurant! I don't know what went wrong but we had a bad experience at this restaurant.,1,1,1,1,September 3 2024
When I reserved the party for the buffet on Monday night I checked the price to be $79.99 per person which is fine. I knew that going in I had a party of six this was going to cost roughly $500. The nearly $800 it actually cost me because of a surprise at the register surcharge due to it being a holiday yet the restaurant serving the same food is kind of crappy though. Caesars goes out of their way to take a lot of extra money from people while providing very little extra value. This has me considering a jump to the MGM rewards program instead honestly.,4,5,5,5,September 3 2024
The food was amazing. great quality. Excellent selection of food and everyone is so friendly and helpful.,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
Amazing amount of selections. except not as many vegan items as we hoped. So many really good looking options. however as many things are prepared bites I could not sample MANY with a dairy allergy. There were 2 vegan cakes which was wonderful. but more options for those with allergies would have been better. As a result I did not feel as though I got my money's worth considering the cost. Also disappointed we could not get our own beverages as our server would not refill our water or pop glasses. We finally asked another staff member if there was a bar and were told our server should have offered that as well!  Overall the buffet did not meet our expectations at all unfortunately.,4,4,3,4,September 2 2024
This buffet is not worth the price. The service is great however the food did not live up to its reputation. All of the seafood options were overcooked and the infamous crab legs are a chore to eat. the insides were mush. The meats from at carving station had no flavor/seasoning. I did find that the veggie options & side items were executed quite nicely. Although there is an array of options the food taste/quality wasn’t worth the $100/pp ticket we paid for. There are other buffets in Las Vegas that I’ve enjoyed much more and didn’t cost as much.,3,2,4,3,September 2 2024
The wait was long. The price was ridiculous. But those aside. had the food been even okay. we could have overlooked those. But the food was less than par. Most of the premade individual dishes were old or boring. The seafood bar was lacking. Many cold dishes. and only 1 place for tiny crab legs. So disappointed. We skipped The Buffet at Bellagio for this. Live and learn a very expensive lesson.,1,1,4,1,September 2 2024
The food was delicious. Our server never cleared our table. There were 4 of us so the plates piled up and just sat there.,4,5,4,4,September 2 2024
It was good. I was expecting so much more! The food was good but not exceptional- and to be timed for 90 minutes. I felt very rushed and not relaxed.  We made a reservation and still had to wait in line for 30 minutes.,3,3,4,4,September 2 2024
This is definitely over price. The food was very disappointed.  The service was ok. You need to wait in the line for more than half hour even you have reservation.  It's not worth it of your time and money.  I wouldn't go again.,3,2,3,4,September 2 2024
Went for lunch on Labor day so it was kind of full. We did have a reservation. I would recommend having one. A lot of options beside crab legs. Very noisy and way too many people.,4,4,3,2,September 2 2024
Great place. Great food selection. Recommend as an experience.,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
Yeah too costly for what we got to eat. For vegetarians it is not a good choice.,2,2,2,3,September 2 2024
The brunch was 100% worth every penny. High quality and a little bit of everything. Waffles. bananas foster French toast. crabs. burria tacos. tostadas. sushi. you name it!!,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
Not impressed. The service was meh. Had to ask a couple of times for water & eventually a different server brought it to us. The one who was serving our table seemed really busy & had difficulty following through or honoring more than one request as she would disappear after my husband’s drink order without asking if I or we needed anything. The food was okay. not great. Even though we had a reservation. we had to wait about 10 mins to get checked in & seated.,2,2,2,2,September 2 2024
I loved totally worth $200 for two people 🤩🤍🤍 food was very delicious 😍,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
Great overall service from the host to buffet service. The food was 3/5 as the seafood was slightly overcooked. Great selection overall with many different cuisines.,4,3,4,4,September 2 2024
Great food lots of food selection  The staff is very friendly,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
Excellent buffet! There were many options and all were delicious. I do recommend getting there 30 minutes before your actual reservation time.,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
It was expensive but good.  Holiday price was $92/person.  Servers were great and food were delicious.  If you had to pick one buffet to experience while in Vegas. this would definitely be a great option.,5,5,5,4,September 2 2024
Burger so raw with no health warnings. I strongly suggest avoiding this place it is not worth the price nor is the food good.,1,1,5,5,September 2 2024
It was great. It was her daughter‘s first time being there from California. She was so excited. She was crying just to be there. but it has changed somewhat since it first opened. I still the best.,5,5,3,5,September 1 2024
Go hungry!  The buffet is very pricey but they have a vast selection of international cuisines and desserts.  Snow crab legs are served hot and cold and same for Maine lobster claws (I preferred the cold because the truffle hot claws were overcooked).  The Dungeness crabs are very good as well and they have sea snails which I have never seen anywhere else.  Enjoy!,4,4,5,5,September 1 2024
Several years ago we were blown away by the buffet.  This time around (9/1/2024) the food was okay and the seafood was actually quite terrible; the lobster claws were chewy and rubbery as if they had been sitting under the lamp too long or were over cooked.  I go for the seafood and that was a huge let down.  Other than that the experience was mediocre at best this time around.  Hopefully someone in corporate gets this message and makes improvements.  Not sure if i will return again based on price and quality of seafood.,2,2,5,5,September 1 2024
My partner and I went for brunch on our anniversary trip. We had reservations and still experienced a long wait since the hostess allowed diamond members to go ahead of everyone even though about 10 of us were already there waiting. We got seated with another couple that had diamond status and our hostess completely ignored us when both parties mentioned it was our first time. I guess you really need that diamond status to get acknowledgment.  As for the food. I was expecting more variety since that’s why we chose this place over the Wynn buffet. However there wasn’t really many dishes that stood out enough to grab. With only 90 minutes we really felt the rush to make our money count since the total for the brunch was $200 without any alcohol. The crab legs were a coin toss half were really good the other half really salty but we grabbed a few plates. to again. make it count. The meat station was decent but some of the little plates were a giant miss like their scallop dish. My partner really loved the pizza and I thought the Asian dishes were good. I didn’t feel like I got my moneys worth or a full stomach in 90 minutes. The desert station was huge but nothing to really talk about besides the taro horchata that was delicious! Overall I’m glad I finally went but probably would not be going back.   Side note. after our brunch we both had stomach pains. I’m not sure if it was from the crab legs but we will definitely be going to the Wynn next time.,3,3,1,2,September 1 2024
Mixed Feelings About Bacchanal Buffet - Caesars Palace Las Vegas  My husband and I recently visited the Bacchanal Buffet. and we left with mixed feelings. The ambiance was loud and noisy. which made it difficult to fully relax and enjoy our meal. While the variety of dishes was impressive. the food itself felt average.  Given the price. we’re not entirely sure the experience was worth it. If you’re seeking a place with a wide selection and don’t mind a lively atmosphere. it might be worth considering. However. if quality and a more serene environment are what you’re after. there may be better options in Las Vegas.,3,2,3,2,September 1 2024
Wasn't the best this time. I thought there was more variety of food.,4,4,4,4,September 1 2024
Ist jeden Preis wert perfekter Service großartige Auswahl schönes Ambiente,5,5,5,5,September 1 2024
Food was amazing! the service was ok! Will definitely go back there.,5,5,2,5,September 1 2024
Would give zero if I could. The SINGLE WORST buffet I have ever been to in my life. Paid $100 and not a single one of us (group of 4) were able to finish a plate. Lobster claw tasted like rubber. crab legs had NO flavour. and I'm sure the cold shrimp was old. Only ok thing was the creme brule. Booked a couple months before coming to Vegas and now I wish I never heard of the place. AVOID this overpriced crap.,1,1,1,1,September 1 2024
Wait time with a reservation can still be long during busy dinner hours and weekends. They prioritize seating Diamond and Cesar’s reward members first and will seat other reservations after they are through seating priority members. Expect to be seated 30-40 minutes after your reservation time.,3,4,3,4,September 1 2024
Food has declined over the years and the quality shows in the food that they serve. Piece of advice. as crowded as it gets on the weekend. that is the best time to go. The turnover and change in food is highest then. if its on the weekdays. no idea how long it sits there.,2,2,4,3,September 1 2024
"Be mindful of ""holiday pricing"" exceeding the original posted pricing. Other than the pricing it was an enjoyable experience.",4,5,4,5,September 1 2024
10/10 would recommend.  Be prepared for a 4-6 hour coma afterwards.,5,5,5,5,September 1 2024
This was a bucket list place for us. We felt the chairs looked dirty which for sure brought down the vibes. We wished some portions. especially the meats were smaller to allow for more tasting and less wastefullness. The deserts overall were low quality and more as though we were at a cafeteria which ends am otherwise higher end meal on a low note.,4,4,5,4,September 1 2024
Although we had a reservation at 4PM. we were not seated until after 4:30. Food was delicious. but pricey. Servers were very attentive. We asked a manager to take a photo of our party. His response was. “Go ask her (pointing to one of the servers). You speak Spanish don’t you?”  None of us are Hispanic or speak Spanish. No need to be arrogant.,3,4,3,4,August 31 2024
We had a reservation and still had to wait almost an hour to be seated. The quality of food for the money was ok at best. The selection of foods available was great. but if a vegetarian they added bacon to a lot of things that normally you would be able to eat. Everyone said it was some of the worst Prime Rib they have ever had. All in all it was disappointing. prob would not go back.,3,3,2,4,August 31 2024
We were NOT disappointed. Wonderful choices Delicious food Pricy though We would consider going back more often if the price was lower. instead we must save up $$$ for once a year feast.,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
"The Bacchanal is one of the exceptional buffets on the Vegas strip. You have to experience this buffet at least once but you must come hungry and you must be a foodie. The Bacchanal is not your ordinary buffet it's a buffet with a little extra ""bling"" for your palate. You will never see dry out food sitting on their burners. The food is always fresh!!! That is probably why you pay more than the other buffets on the strip. Like they say ""You get what you pay for!!!"".",4,4,3,3,August 31 2024
Had a reservation at 2:45. paid and they sent me to an hour and a half line. Left and ask for a refund.,1,1,1,1,August 31 2024
Good food and selection. service was not the  best though,5,5,4,4,August 31 2024
Plenty of variety. service and ambience was great. 90mins not enough to try various options but they were very lenient with the time. We spent enough time so have a full experience.,3,4,5,5,August 31 2024
VERY long wait. About an hour and we had a reservation… but the food. staff and atmosphere was amazing,4,5,3,5,August 31 2024
The food was good and the quality was great I would go back compared to the Wynn buffet I liked this one more.,5,4,4,4,August 31 2024
Wonderful experience.  The best buffet I've ever had.,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
Every time I come here I’m amazed at how great the food is I typically don’t eat buffet food however this place is an exception to the rule. The food is fresh and the place is clean all the time. It’s such a vibe and worth every dime! If you haven’t been please go,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
The food tasted amazing. however nothing was hot. All the dishes that were supposed to be hot were Luke warm/almost cold. For the expensive $90 buffet. the food should be piping hot. Also. our server. was not as attentive as he should have been. I had yo ask home for paper napkins over 3 times. because he kept bringing on 2 or 3. Everything else was fine.,4,4,3,5,August 31 2024
Cost was higher than advertised online. Food was cold. Food was raw. Servers were hard to find.,1,1,1,3,August 31 2024
Si es caro. Para desquitar el precio hay que llegar con hambre. El mesero tardado para el café y llevarse los platos sucios.,5,5,3,5,August 31 2024
Love all the food options. first time will definitely be coming back,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
The Lobster Claws and Prime Rib was soo good. Enjoyed our server very nice lady. The dessert table was amazing. We had the Mochi donuts and crème brûlée. Would definitely come back!,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
Mass quantities of good food.That is what you get here.If you desire fine dining - look elsewhere. But if you want tons of good seafood (and other solid non-seafood options). this is your place.,5,5,5,4,August 31 2024
The food was really good. Crab legs and claws. meat cutting station and variety of foods from Mexican to Asian to Mediterranean. My only problem is the extremely high price. It was $92 per person and with tax and tip. over $100. That’s a bit excessive. I wanted to try this buffet at least once and it was good. but there are other buffets in Vegas that have crab legs. seafood and the meat station that are not as expensive. Next time I’m in Vegas. I’m going to one of those.,4,5,4,4,August 31 2024
The quality of the food was good but for over $90 a head it should be. I have been going to Caesars for over 20 years and I understand prices have gone up. However I had my family of seven and it was a $700 tab.,3,4,2,3,August 31 2024
Large selection of food for the cravings. price was accordingly with the price; hot and tasty. The service was average ok. We were seated in a table w a broken chair they didn’t care much.,5,5,3,4,August 31 2024
There is a variety of food but the price you pay is not worth it. A lot of the food tastes bland or too salty. Definitely not worth the $100 per person (with tip+tax). The restaurant looks nice though and it’s convenient. but that’s about it.,2,2,4,4,August 31 2024
Must do in Vegas. Definitely make a reservation to get seated asap.,5,5,5,3,August 31 2024
Great food… the fee was pricey but the food was great,4,5,4,5,August 31 2024
90 minute time period goes by too fast when you constantly need to wait in line to get your food. 120 minutes is more appropriate on busy nights.,4,4,5,5,August 31 2024
Not a big buffet person but I was totally impressed with their huge selection. Wish I could eat/taste them all. It a little over whelming. piece of advice. before coming here better plan what you really want to eat and phase yourself. It’s all worth the money.,5,5,5,4,August 31 2024
Food was delicious. Well organized and Server was great,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
Worth it  . but must explain about time to eat . Food is really good !,5,5,4,5,August 30 2024
About 1/3 of the hot foods are cold. The seafood selection has become extremely limited and the quality has gone down over the years. however. the price keeps going up. It is now almost $100 per person. Not worth the money.,1,1,1,4,August 30 2024
The food was bad. Very. very bad. The monkeybread could chip teeth. I chopped at it with my fork and some of the bread chipped off. Lots of stale food that had been out FAR too long.   It was so bad. I cancelled my reservations for The Buffet at Wynn and others (one per evening for the 4 evenings I had in Vegas).  I moved out of Vegas 10 years ago. and I would say Bacchanal had been on par with Sunset Station 10 years ago.,1,1,4,1,August 30 2024
Overall one of the best buffets on the strip so many different choices great atmosphere,5,5,5,5,August 30 2024
Crab legs like rubber and unable to snap open. Shrimp was over cooked both in boiled section and mexican dish.  Buffet seemed small and with all of the mirrored columns it was hard to tell .,2,2,3,3,August 30 2024
Went on Labor Day weekend. a little pricey but it was Worth the money . Loved all the options,5,5,5,5,August 30 2024
Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,2,5,4,2,August 30 2024
Went for breakfast/brunch on a Friday morning at 9am.  Food was delicious . my server Mary was terrific !   I was surprised to see the price at $89 even in the morning but to be fair . the buffet was fully stocked with all items you can find on the dinner buffet .  Thankfully my buffet was comped by my casino host.  I was really only interested in the breakfast items and no desire to eat seafood in the morning .  Overall a great experience but if I had to pay for it . I would have gone elsewhere for breakfast.,5,5,5,5,August 30 2024
Everything we tried was great. Especially the seafood section.,5,5,5,5,August 30 2024
I want to start by saying please read the directions on the reservation. The reservation holds your spot in the line. not your going straight to a table. We had a mix up. but was explained this well.  First time here and I did enjoy it. Came for my son’s 12th birthday and he’s a picky eater. but he really loved it. He enjoyed the burgers and mochi donuts. He liked the salmon too.  The crab legs are regulated for a reason. If they weren’t. people would take all of them at once from everyone. The crab legs were pretty good and they precut them so it was easier to crack open.  The chilled lobster claws were so good. The staff were super nice also. Even thought it was a 90min eating time. they never made me feel rushed. I didn’t see them checking our ticket for time or anything.  This is an expensive 90$ per person buffet. There are so many selection of different cuisines to choose from.,4,4,5,4,August 30 2024
The quality of the food being served here is no better than eating at a HomeTown Buffet.  I was incredibly disappointed because this is supposed to be the best buffet in Vegas.  The food was overcooked. sat in heat lamps too long and just did not taste good at all.  After this experience. I will not be eating at buffets anymore.  If you don’t care about the quality or taste of the food you are eating. then by all means visit this place as often as you like.   Oh and I don’t know what the point of a reservation is because a walk-in party was seated before us and arrived after us as well.,1,1,3,2,August 30 2024
We have been Doing Buffets at Bellagio for over 30 years recently to our dislike they have cut back. Ceasers Buffet was recommended by a friend. It was a little pricey but I will say we thought it was worth every penny. My wife is asian I am Italian and our food taste differ. The selection is endless and compliments to the chefs. Great flavors cooked to perfection . The Service and attitude of the employees was courteous and friendly. There was Plenty of selection to satisfy my wife and myself. We can't wait to come back.  Please don't change. In the Casino the dealers were also friendly and courteous unlike our current experience at The Bellagio Tables. I would advise reservations for the Buffet.,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
It was so great we ate there twice during our 5 day stay. Service was great the first time. The second time it seemed our waitress cared more to talk to coworkers then her guests.,5,5,4,5,August 29 2024
This is my 3rd trip to this restaurant during my travels to Vegas and it never disappoints. If you are looking for a variety of foods from different cultures. this is where you want to go.,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
This is pretty much the same type of brunch you would find anywhere else.  I don’t think anything was outstanding. There was very good food and not so good food. It all depends on what you like.  Unless it’s a popular item. the food may sit. Note. you do not have to Pay the tip at the same time you are paying for the meal. You can pay the tip at the table after you eat. You only have 90 Minutes to sit at the table. I recommend going on off hours When there are not massive lines to wait for food. This made it more enjoyable.,4,4,4,3,August 29 2024
We had a 1p reservation. got there a few minutes early. I was using a mobility scooter and they put us up fairly close to entrance. food. and a couple of “walkways” so I could get where I needed to be! I used a cane to/ from food… The crab/ seafood brunch had a lot of crab legs. shrimp. muscles. clams. and a bunch of fish options… including seafood tacos. eggs Benedict with crab cake base… along with carved prime rib. sliced flank steak… in all about 75-100 ft of hot & chilled items… with a huge stand alone desert island!! Our serving team was responsive… in all a great experience,5,4,5,4,August 29 2024
Hard to even find a buffet little alone. a great buffet it’s worth the money more or less nostalgic these days ￼,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Awesome elegant buffet! Everything from crab legs to caviar. prime rib and oh so much more!,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Service was great. Unfortunately. all the food was lukewarm at most. Some was hard from being under the lamps for so long. Tri-tip was delish. but temp too low.,3,2,4,4,August 29 2024
Food was not as good as I’d hoped. I wouldn’t recommend.,3,3,4,4,August 29 2024
Food is what you would expect for a buffet.  Felt it was overpriced for the quality. way better places to eat on strip,3,2,4,1,August 29 2024
The wait for this restaurant was so ridiculous. it ruins the entire evening. There's seemingly no point in having reservations because everyone goes in the same line anyway. with everyone passed by VIP members as they come up. The seafood was good. but carving meats were disappointing and dry. The back room had great options though. but overall not worth the time and money,3,3,5,4,August 29 2024
Slow seating. Made a reservation for 6 pm. Got table at 6:30 pm. You have to go through several lines even at Diamond level to get your table,3,5,5,3,August 29 2024
Food was cold  and i dont understand why it was so cold,3,1,5,5,August 29 2024
Overpriced . other Vegas buffets are cheaper and better food. Servers were too slow to pick up used plates. Somehow the chefs gets offended when asked to use clean knife before cutting me piece of meat due to food allergy.,3,4,3,3,August 29 2024
Best buffet in Vegas. will go there next time. Very recommended. there are many different choices of food. like asian food. seafood. pizza… and they are very fresh. There is few seafood which is salty. that is the only thing I cared about.,5,5,4,3,August 29 2024
Was expecting more from what people said. was definitely disappointed with the type of food and the quality of what was served. For the price it was not worth it for me,3,2,5,2,August 29 2024
Pésimo el Servicio. los meseros ( ojo es Bufet) en general con muy mala actitud. su trabajo es llevar las bebidas y los platos y las dos cosas las hacen muy mal. no es  barato 90 dólares por persona par el mal  servicio que brindan . muchas zonas de oportunidad,1,4,1,2,August 29 2024
Food quality is fair. the meats selection was quite salty. Our section of tables did not get cleaned frequently empty plates were not cleared.,3,2,4,2,August 28 2024
Impressive dining experience.  Amazing food options. Make sure you have reservations and get there early.,5,5,5,5,August 28 2024
I have been coming to this buffet since it opened. Although it’s on the pricey side. I think it’s worth every penny!  I’m not sure if the head chef is new or not. but the quality and deliciousness of the food is the best it has ever been! The seared scallops and salmon were so good!  How can they do that at a buffet?!  I can’t wait to come back and enjoy a yummy meal!,5,5,5,5,August 28 2024
Great experience. Lots to choose from. various different options! Lots of desserts and drinks! Only downside is having to wait a while past your booking time due to the amount of people. but that wouldn’t put me off going,5,5,5,5,August 28 2024
Bacchanal never disappoints. You get upscale restaurant quality food but its a buffet. I always make my reservation 2 months in advance to make sure I get in.,5,5,5,5,August 28 2024
Ran out of lobsters and none were brought back during our 90 mins sitting.,3,3,3,5,August 28 2024
Very disappointed. We had to wait despite having a reservation. This has a Huge dining room with way too many people. Felt like we had to fight for a spot at the Buffett. Some of the lobster was still frozen. Service was TERRIBLE.! Maybe poor service was due to lack of tip on original receipt but I leave a cash tip. Never saw our server again after getting our drinks.,2,2,1,1,August 28 2024
Very expensive and options were okay but could have more for the price. We got 1 drink and the lady never asked us again if we needed a refill.,3,3,1,5,August 28 2024
I feel like there weren’t a lot of selections for dessert. Overall it’s a nice buffet just would have been nice to have more dessert options. The food was okay too just had high expectations for this buffet since the reviews were so good.,3,2,4,4,August 28 2024
To be honest. I was very disappointed.  The Crab was not very good. shrimp was over cooked.  I felt rushed through our dinner. 90 minutes allowed to eat.  Our server came over several times to check on our receipt to see how much longer we had.  For the price we paid. it was not what it used to be.  The desserts were very small.  The overall experience was poor.  I would not recommend this buffet for the price you have to pay.,3,3,2,2,August 28 2024
The brisket was the best for me. the crabs and lobster could use some seasoning. the desert was good and the right portions.  The brisket was excellent.,3,3,5,3,August 27 2024
Had a great experience. Staff was great. table service exceptional. Never had a empty plate on the table when finished. drinks always filled. Very impressive. Food selection and taste was awesome frome main selection to desert.,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
Should  not have to wait 3 months for reservations … but we’ll be back 👍,4,4,5,5,August 27 2024
Didn’t quite live up to expectations. Good. but not exceptional as you would expect for the price. I have had better dining experiences on the side of the road in Thailand for a fraction of the cost. but this is worth a try at least once.,3,3,3,3,August 27 2024
Food was all cold. area worn out and old. navigating to the food was an obstacle course having to go thru all tables to find your way. Most importantly food was sub par.  I ’d never go back!!!,1,1,5,1,August 27 2024
It was wonderful! But very cramped. Ton of people walking around. It would seem to me that since the casino floor is so huge that you could have set aside a little more room for the buffet. I mean you got people cramped in there like sardines. But it was very good,5,5,4,3,August 27 2024
The experience was amazing. I celebrated my 61th birthday with friends. The reservation was painless and ensured we did not get disappointed. We had two servers that completely took care of us and with a big smile. Thank you Bacchanal for doing an amazing job taking care of locals.,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
Eat crabs legs and dont drink much to save as much room for all of the great food,5,5,5,5,August 26 2024
So many food options. Tri tip was amazing. Sear salmon with risotto was phenomenal.,5,5,5,5,August 26 2024
Pretty expensive for what they offer. Food was fine for a buffet but probably wouldn’t eat there again due to the price.,3,3,4,3,August 26 2024
Es gibt einfach alles! Die Auswahl ist riesig und fast alles. was wir gegessen haben. war lecker. Nicht ganz günstig (für Kinder. die wenig essen lohnt es sich wohl weniger). aber für Menschen. die gerne essen und gerne Neues probieren super!,5,4,5,4,August 26 2024
Great buffet. With all different varieties definitely worth the price,5,5,5,4,August 26 2024
Mal sistema de reservas y pésimo ingreso. caro para lo que es,3,3,2,3,August 26 2024
There wasn’t much that stood out at this buffet. One thing that I enjoyed were the lobster claws. Easy to peel and solid. The crabs/snow crab felt old or overcooked. Even with the easy cracking scored on the legs. the meat always broke so I always had to dig out the meat. Brisket was overcooked and dry. they sliced me a huge piece that I only took one bite of. and the server took it away with no questions. Very expensive for what’s suppose to be a luxury buffet. If the quality went up. I’d be much happier with the price.,3,3,3,4,August 26 2024
We went on a Sunday it was extremely busy be prepared to wait.  Food was good I would advise not taking the front offering if no one has taken any it would have been sitting there for hours not very good! Other than that it’s probably worth $40 not $80 we will not be back!,3,4,5,5,August 26 2024
Edgar the supervisor was very accommodating and he made sure our experience there was great. The food selection is great. There’s something for everyone to enjoy. Their dessert section was an obvious fave. The crème brûlée was delish that I had to have another one!,5,4,5,4,August 26 2024
I was so excited to come to the palace and eat a wonderful meal at the buffet. but I was so disappointed first of all with the nearby restrooms by the buffet. They were so filthy and disgusting as I was entering the buffet with my boyfriend and going up to the new food such as the Birria ramen or Asian food section everything was so hard and very tasteless along with other food there such as the dessert wasn’t good at all and for 2 people paying $210 dollars is insane for cold hard flavorless food I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone but the service was nice I also had to wait another 30 minutes within being on time to my reservation.,2,1,3,3,August 26 2024
We had reservations at 5:00 pm. By the time they sat us it was close to 5:30 pm. We then waited for more than ten minutes to give our beverage order. None of the food we ate was at a decent temperature and none of it was worth going back for. We will not be returning. Huge disappointment.,2,1,1,3,August 26 2024
The food was excellent. great selection. The seafood was cooked perfectly service was exceptional.￼,5,5,5,5,August 26 2024
The best buffet in Vegas!  We love all the food and must visit!,5,5,5,4,August 25 2024
Too much foods but poor quality especially for Asian or Italian foods choices.,2,2,2,2,August 25 2024
For people with seafood allergies for that price they need to have at least a high-quality variety of steaks made to order. Otherwise there’s no way a person with the shellfish allergy can possibly get their value for the dollar.,5,5,5,3,August 25 2024
Th food was OK. service was awful. The price was ridiculous.,4,4,2,3,August 25 2024
Super. super. super. super. super. super. super.super,5,5,5,5,August 25 2024
The main food worth eating was the seafood/crab legs. felt everything was very subpar. especially for the price. It was nearly $100 a person after everything and you can get way better food in Vegas for that amount. Dessert section could probably be skipped all together which is always a bummer. This was for sure a one time stop for me. Unless I just want to eat gobs of crab legs. then it’s probably worth going.,3,3,3,3,August 25 2024
The food was ok. options limited to good food. most of the options around cheap food. I consider waste of money. Wynn buffets is much better.,2,3,1,2,August 25 2024
If you can't find something wonderful to eat here - you either aren't hungry or are the pickiest human alive.  Best made to order omelet you'll ever have. The chef is talented and friendly. not a usual combination.,5,5,5,4,August 25 2024
The food is amazing and there are a lot of options to try. they are all just delicious. however. the servers are not very friendly and will give you attitude if you ask for something that is not available on the floor for you to grab. Overall the experience is very good and I will come back again.,5,5,1,5,August 25 2024
Amazing choices and very hospitable staff  definitely coming back to have another meal . Thanks so much for everything !! With the price $$,5,5,5,4,August 25 2024
One of the best buffets I've been too. Amazing staff overall. The manager was great and he listens to his customers. Food was beyond expectations.,5,5,5,5,August 25 2024
The food is good The service is just like any other buffet: dirty tables. messy. etc.,3,4,2,2,August 25 2024
Got in line to check in for a reservation. then directed to the cashier to pay for the dinner.  then you are put in another line to wait to be seated. Knowing I'd still have to wait additional time to get a table. I tried checking in 30 min before my reservation time but was rudely told I could only be checked in 15 min prior. Not to mention that you only have 90 min to eat at your table.  Matters worsen when finally seated. our waitress didn't come for our drink order until 10 min later. The rushed feeling of having to get our food within the alloted time. really killed our appetite.  By the way. the buffet price is way overpriced for the lack of quality in the food they were serving. Dry brisket. dry prime rib... Prime rib with no au jus!?!? Save your $ & spend it on the Wynn who serve a better buffet. As recommended by some Caesers & taxi employees.,2,2,2,1,August 25 2024
Being seven stars means nothing anymore. Sat us in  direct sunlight and chairs needed to be repaired.  They did ask us if seating was ok but why even put someone there in first place? Value well it’s a matter of what you eat I guess.  Will probably not be back to the Buffet. Caesars needs to do some upgrades to their locations.,3,5,2,3,August 25 2024
Great foods. Staff was wonderful and caring  will definitely visit again,4,4,4,4,August 25 2024
Overall a great place! The seafood was so good. especially the crab legs. My husband. my dad. and I were in seafood heaven. They had great non seafood options for those who don’t like that sort of thing. My mom had the brisket and she said it was perfectly tender and very tasty. It is expensive but it’s a buffet so go and enjoy and eat until your heart is content!,5,5,3,4,August 24 2024
It would be awesome if they did something for locals. Our server Michael ? (5ft 6 thin build glasses)  ￼was awesome. Stood out  for his friendliness and good attitude.  Only issue is if you have reservation for 3:30 table should be ready not wait  extra 45 minutes in line  while we saw high rollers and big parties go in front of us right away   Also host staff greeters iPad not very cordial they just moved us along and didn’t explain the additional line and wait,5,5,5,3,August 24 2024
we were so satisfied everything was good loved it definitely coming back !,5,5,5,5,August 24 2024
I believe the experience is really great unfortunately I’m not the biggest seafood person Due to being mildly allergic. but everything was great. The food was good just for my preferences. I believe the price point was too high.,5,5,5,5,August 24 2024
It was as expected! The crab Weekend was the best and crab legs were so soft and lean as you wanted them to be. As promised. you'll find all types of international cuisine: Asian. Mexican. Italian. Mediterranean. American. breakfast at lunch. desserts....all you want. Make sure to make a reservation first if you don't want to wait long time to get in so plan ahead and arrive 15min earlier.,5,5,4,5,August 24 2024
The service was great the people were fast and considerate. The food was good but with how busy it was. I was surprised how cold the food was.,3,2,5,3,August 24 2024
I've been to Vegas so many times but never got around to visiting Bacchanal ! Me and my King have date night once a month so I decided to do something different mainly because he's never been to Las Vegas. Long story short this is by far the best buffet we have ever attended. Name anything and they have it. I had a small complaint about the shrimp and I spoke with Ed one of the managers and in 30 minutes the executive chef comes to the table with a personal seafood boil and it was amazing! Ed was as good as a manager I've ever met. He was ready to go above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied!  GO TO THIS PLACE!,5,5,5,5,August 24 2024
Its busy. but has the most selection out of any buffet on the strip.,4,5,5,4,August 24 2024
Staff very unfriendly and experience extremely overpriced.,1,2,1,1,August 24 2024
The best variety at a buffet I’ve ever seen which is an amazing feature but the overall quality wasn’t the best. I would return to enjoy with new guests but idk if I’d return again on my own mainly due to the price point. After tax and tip. it was well over $100/pp.  The most impressive to me personally was the Asian options available! The pho and ramen bar with delicious toppings such as Thai basil. sriracha and hoisin packets. crispy shallots. cilantro and green onions. The flavor of the pho I got was authentic and delicious! I’ve also never seen Chinese roast duck at a buffet and crispy roast pork! Both tasted authentic (like it should at a Chinese bbq restaurant). The lumpia was fantastic and crispy. The Korean short ribs were also delicious (you gotta eat them hot!). My partner said the lamb chops were one of the best he’s ever had.  What could improve was the poke (hate that it’s on top of a bed of rice). the lobster claw I got were soooo salty but my partner said his was not salty so that could have been a one off (It was huge so I didn’t want to try another). The sushi looked very mediocre with full of rice so I didn’t touch or try any of it. For the price. I wish they had more nigiri and sashimi options although they did have one or two “sashimi” options but they placed each piece in a little plastic plate and dressed it up with sauce and garnish so you must take the plastic plate with you for each piece of sashimi.  Overall. it was a very Vegas experience but we do prefer the Wynn buffet over bacchanal if we had to pick just one. If you have elderly asian people in your dining group. then they may enjoy bacchanal more due to the large variety of Asian dishes that they may enjoy more.,4,4,5,4,August 24 2024
The restaurant required us to pay at the counter before being escorted to our seats. and they reminded us that the price didn’t include tips. We decided to leave the tip after our meal. However. when the waiter saw that no tip was included on the receipt. he ignored us and provided no further service. including not removing our used plates from the table. It was a very bad experience. In the end. we decided to leave only a 10% tip in cash on the table. We won’t recommend this restaurant to our friends.,3,3,1,2,August 24 2024
In my opinion. food quality was not worth the price paid,2,2,5,2,August 24 2024
Very good service! Got there an hour before my reservation time and was able to get seated. Pork shops were crazy! Best buffet I've been to.,5,5,5,5,August 24 2024
The Caesars Palace Bucchanal Buffet has an iconic vibe.  Incredible experience for my daughter’s small wedding party.  Everyone ate like kings. The restaurant even had gluten free choices available to guests when we planned ahead via certain buffet items and special request for chef.  Amazing lobster claws. mini sliders. and mini desserts.  Great service and ambiance.   Bacchanal Buffet is the best buffet and price was worth it!,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Way overpriced for the quality. The selection for many areas was laughable.,2,2,4,3,August 23 2024
The best buffet! Loads of fresh seafood and prime beef. Freshly prepared and presented sides and entrees were delicious. The menu rotates as well so each experience is slightly different. We can’t wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Food was excellent. but a few dishes were crazy salty! There was a lot of choices. Was able to try a few things I'd never had before. The time limit is unfortunate but doable. The price is insane. not quite worth $200 for 2 people.,4,4,4,4,August 23 2024
Great selection. Lobster. crab. prime rib. Service was outstanding. if your going to order bubbles order the bottle not the Momosa combo its cheaper and they'll bring you the OJ anyway.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Biggest waste of money ever. And this is in Vegas…,1,1,1,1,August 23 2024
We sort of stumbled upon the Bacchanal Buffet.  We had just checked into Caesars Palace and were looking for a bite. so we thought.  Well. let me tell you. this place is the best buffet we have ever been to!!  The selections are endless. every item is very high quality. fresh. and prepared to perfection.  The endless seafood was spectacular.  The carving station was out of the world.  The desert station was insane.  Even if we don't stay at Caesars Palace during our next visit to Vegas. we will for sure make a reservation at Bacchanal Buffet.  Treat yourself!  You will not be disappointed.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
It was an initial visit for most the our party.  Everyone enjoyed the food and the ambience.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
The food was amazing.  Not just the quantity and variety. but the quality was actually top notch. Everything we ate tasted amazing. I'm so glad we finally got to try this place and I can't wait to go back.,5,5,4,5,August 23 2024
The meat was mid. The sides were fantastic. Deserts were really good!,4,4,5,5,August 23 2024
Das einzige was richtig warm war . war das Fleisch was frisch geschnitten wurde. Für das Geld für 3 Personen haben wir schon viel bessere gegessen.,3,3,3,3,August 23 2024
It is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Delicious food.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
This buffet experience was a buffet on steroids!!! So Much to choose from !! High quality food choices. From main dishes to desserts.  a wide variety of every food category.  The line up goes very fast. don't be deceived by the amount of people waiting. it's very organized. Example. we were #50 on the waiting list. less then 10 minutes we were called to be seated. Enjoy !!!,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Loved my waitress. the restaurant. decor.  The food this time was not as great as it usually is.  Driving all the way from Arizona and the cost of the buffet was not worth it this time.  Going back to Vegas soon.  We will see if the food quality improves.,5,4,5,5,August 23 2024
The area was beautiful and the services and workers we all pleasant! The food was well prepared our dinner was perfect we enjoyed it!,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Over rated….The food is going downhill not as good as before and  the service sucks..Needs improvements..Hi to the Wynn Buffet instead ..way .way better ..,3,3,2,2,August 23 2024
This is the second time I have come in a years time. It was amazing the first time and was again from the impeccable service to the quality of the food! One of my favorite stops in vegas.,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024
It was good but erytime we go the price goes up. Could have been a little better for the prce.,4,4,5,4,August 22 2024
This has been the best buffet I have eaten at in years!  Great food exceptional customer skills and the atmosphere was top notch. We return on my next visit to Vegas,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024
A lovely location. a huge variety of foods. especially loved that they had gluten free chocolate chip cookies. the crab was cold so slightly disappointed in that. When the snow crab came out the line up was huge so wait till it dies down. It will be tepid and you’ll need crackers to cut it (unlike Palms hotel buffet) and it was a bit dry. Great to have the clarified butter. Overall a great choice for variety in a nice atmosphere.,4,4,4,4,August 22 2024
I found the food to be honestly quite bland. everyone I went with agreed. The service was great and it was quick to get in. Best station was the ready to order soup station and the desserts. Everything else felt under seasoned. Even though I left full. I was craving a more satisfying meal.,2,2,5,4,August 22 2024
Loved everything. Starting with the friendly hostesses who showed us where to leave our luggage. to the friendly wait staff and the food was delicious. Can’t wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024
Not worth the price for the quality. The food is just mediocre.,2,2,3,3,August 22 2024
Wonderful buffet as always. We loved the lobster claws the best. The dessert bar was out of this world. Pricey but worth it!,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024
I have been to Bacchanal dozens of times over the last 20+ years and I think this will be my last visit. While the food and variety continue to be top-notch. everything else about the experience is abysmal.  First of all. your reservation here is pointless. They stopped honoring reservations and still make you stand in line. I waited for 30+ minutes despite having a reservation.  Secondly. the service is beyond terrible. Even more of a slap in the face when you are tipping in advance (20% of a $100/pp meal) and then lucky to even get a single drink refill. For how much they are charging. they should be able to hire more wait staff. who seem to be stretched very thin and cover too many tables.  Lastly there is the price. ~$100/pp is just a stupid amount to pay especially when that doesn’t include alcohol. You can eat at most 5-star restaurants for that price and get seated at your reservation time and get quality service. There are other buffets that are half the price. with just as good of quality. and almost as wide of a selection.,3,5,1,5,August 22 2024
The food was good but not as good as in past year's.  The table service staff were great but seemed a bit overwhelmed as it took quite a while to get drink refills even though they were working their butts off.  More staff or larger drink glasses would be a improvement.   My main complaint is with the reservation and service policies.   If I have a reservation for 7pm I believe it is reasonable to expect not to have to stand in 3 lines and have it be over an hour after your reservation before you are seated.  You apparently have learned to take the reservation now you just need to learn how reservations actually are supposed to work.,3,3,4,3,August 22 2024
It would be nice to come to this buffet ONCE and see that the price hasn't increased a third time in a year or less. More Value For Money if you just go to The Buffet At Wynn.,3,3,2,3,August 22 2024
Lots of high-end food. and very attentive waiters to keep drink glasses filled.  We were slightly taken aback at the price of 84.99 apiece. but we were very pleased with the quality of the food. Asian section very good: duck. dim sum. Korean ribs.  Snow crab legs. lobster claws. Dungeness crab all delicious. Desserts aren't as impressive as the main dishes. but creme brulee was good. and crepes looked good...   They let us stay a bit longer than the 90 minutes noted at the table. which is kind of a good thing. because the layout is so huge that it can take a few minutes to get from one end to the other...,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024
I was not impressed with any single food item.. where I wanted more. The price is not worth it at all. 85 person is too high for food quality and varieties.,2,2,4,2,August 21 2024
There are lots of different varieties of foods that I can choose from. I think it is worth it to go there for dinner.😁,5,5,5,5,August 21 2024
El precio está un poco elevado para lo que ofrecen. éramos 4 y dos nos enfermamos del el estómago . a bajado un poco la calidad con respecto a antes de la pandemia,4,3,3,4,August 21 2024
This was definitely the best buffet that I have ever been. The food was excellent. However. the 90 minute time limit for the buffet is ridiculous especially since it’s expensive at $90 a person.,5,5,4,5,August 21 2024
The experience was very good. The food is very tasty. even if due to the high price I thought that some foods. such as lobster. were more. However. the quality of the food is high and the staff is ready to help you for everything,4,5,5,4,August 21 2024
Everything was just ok. nothing extraordinary. not sure if it’s worth the value,3,3,5,5,August 21 2024
Good buffet Lot of choices Price is 89 USD per person Dessert Buffet is quite poor  But good plqce to go,4,4,4,4,August 21 2024
We had 8:00PM reservations at the Bacchanal Buffet - Caesars Palace Las Vegas. Upon checking in we were told to stand in line. which took 25 minutes before being seated. The food was very good and abundant. with many choices. The quality was above average for a buffet. The $92per person price with tax but no tip. per person was a bit high. Overall. I would recommend it as a one-time experience when in Las Vegas.,4,4,4,3,August 21 2024
How they can charge $85 for this is beyond me. We couldn’t eat the shellfish as it must have been cooked In vats of salt.  It’s a one hit for us.  Not worth it.  The buffet at the Wynn is so much better,1,1,3,1,August 21 2024
One of favorite spots to go to. It is a must have for every trip! Fabulous food. amazing staff and the price is unbeatable for what you get! Highly recommended!,5,5,5,5,August 21 2024
Very good for the most part. Definitely an experience. The prices have gotten way too high. The Prime Rib is just ok,4,4,4,5,August 21 2024
Fue una buena experiencia. había mucha variedad de platillos y nos gustó mucho en general,5,5,5,5,August 21 2024
Too pricey for what you eat.  Thank God I had enough Caesars reward credits to pay for 2 at this buffet.  $170 for 2 people?.  I get it. its Las Vegas. however. COLD CRAB LEGS?  I came a couple years ago and you can smell the warm crab legs.  But this time you decide to make them cold?  I CANT EAT COLD CRAB LEGS!!!!!!!!  Yes there are a lot of choices for different cultures. however. not enough veggies. not enough salad bar. no real ice cream you get sorbet (which I hate).     I will never come there again.,2,2,5,5,August 21 2024
Overall it was absolutely amazing . I loved the frog. the brisket and the turkey . So much to try: The kids price should be lower. I paid 50 dollars for my little one to eat just white rice and three pieces of sushi. But overall it was lovely . It was absolutely delicious and will return,5,5,5,4,August 21 2024
A lot of hype for what was a fairly poor buffet.  The vast range of choice and volume of food shows with food generally over cooked. lacking flavour and containing a lot of fat.,2,2,4,2,August 20 2024
The Bacchanal Buffet has lost its position as our top buffet restaurant choice.  The food quality and quantity has gone down hill.  Yes. quantity has gone down. for example no crepe station.  The line to get in is still long. so if you plan to go think about making a reservation or be prepared a long wait.,3,3,2,2,August 20 2024
Seafood portion especially shells. oyster seems very small. Meat section was good.,4,4,5,5,August 20 2024
All of the food was cold….all of it. The waiter was rude and acted inconvenienced by our presence. The cost of the meal should at least result in HOT food. bare minimum.,1,1,1,2,August 20 2024
The price of the buffet has sky rocketed to almost $90 a person. PROS: Black garlic ramen made to order Street taco station Carving station and bone marrow  CONS: Lobster claws are over cooked No longer have different types of fish cooked gourmet (sea bass. salmon. mahi etc.) No longer include mimosas for brunch now it’s a $40-$45 charge extra  Summary at $90 a person with a 1 1/2 hour limit how much can you actually eat? Or drink if you pay an additional $40 some dollars,4,5,5,4,August 20 2024
Second time at bacchanal. the first was for brunch buffet and this time was the dinner buffet.  Great variety of different foods. including crab legs and lobster. Even different kinds of crab legs and both hot and cold. Everything was delicious. and for the price. the quality of food is really there.,5,5,5,5,August 20 2024
Servers were rude and seemed over worked. The food was mediocre at best. Was expecting much better quality and quantity for the price paid. Very disappointing.,1,1,1,3,August 20 2024
Delicious. Would have preferred more spacious seating and better Asian food though. The Chinese food was cheap. Seat food selection was exceptional.,5,5,5,4,August 19 2024
Very good food. Many great options to choose from. Staff very friendly. The only problem I had was the all you can eat crab legs. It was several people filling up multiple plates at a time which made the line very long. But. I appreciated when a staff member started serving them. The line started to move much faster.,4,4,5,4,August 19 2024
Everything was amazing. great quality of food and service. Must try everything!!,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
I believe everyone should go to this place. just because of the experience. There is a lot of food to partake in. a lot of the food is average food that you have already eaten before but because of the experience inside the Caesars Palace and the presentation that is what makes it all worthwhile.,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
Good experience. Great selection of delicious foods. Service was good and pleasant. Omelette made to order. Great selection of breakfast. lunch. and dinner foods. Only drawback was $70 fee. Then add a tip. Vegas experience 😀,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
Food variety was great. Especially if you’re a seafood lover. the selection from seafood boil to lobster claws was *chef’s kiss*. Attentive service. While a little pricey it was definitely worth the cost.,4,5,5,4,August 19 2024
Expensive but not much more than some far worse buffets on the strip.,5,5,4,3,August 19 2024
A little disappointing. Nothing really was amazing,3,3,3,3,August 19 2024
For the price. it honestly wasn’t worth it. We were all excited for all the different kitchen options but the only things that stood out were the carving station. crab legs (until the 4th batch as that was over cooked) and the crepe station. The quality of all the food was the biggest issue. We tried it all… and nothing but disappointment. Esthetically it as beautiful and our waitress was amazing.. but other than that it’s just the hype. Would not recommend going…,2,2,5,5,August 19 2024
Food was COLD. Dining area unattractive. crowded and noisy. Quality of food did not merit the price,1,1,1,1,August 19 2024
Came here visit for vacation. had more expectations than what we experienced. Overall. it’s great location in the Caesars Palace. walking distance to the Strip. The unsatisfied parts are people are limited to 90mins of eating time. seafood is not fresh enough. Other cuisines are decent. Each person is a bit pricey,3,3,5,4,August 18 2024
The Bacchanal has been my favorite buffet for over 20 years. but it keeps changing and not for the best. At arrival. our table had food stains. so I asked the waitress if there were wipes I could have to clean. I don’t mind cleaning the table. but she said she would get someone. Our waitress didn’t speak English and because she wore a mask. it was even harder to understand. I arrived with my family of which some only speak Russian and they were even more confused when the waitress was explaining the drinks. I asked for flat water or water bottle and she said she would charge extra which I didn’t care.  Bacchanal prices have increased. but the food quality and service have decreased. It is no longer worth the “buffet” experience.,4,3,2,4,August 18 2024
Incredible variety of food. Well worth it! We rolled out of there lol,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
Overpriced  for what you get. The quality is typical buffet food.,4,3,3,3,August 18 2024
Amazing quality and many options to choose from. Will definitely come for another visit!,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
The food was excellent. with plenty of different selections available.  It is a bit pricey.,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
Everything was perfect. the best treatment I have ever received at a a buffet. I liked dining there so much I want to go back. The staff was excellent. There was a staff member a lady there at the buffet section who looked like she was having a bad day. and when I talked to her she was so nice it seemed I was talking to a different person. I just think it's kind of expensive because I didn't eat as much as I thought I would just because there is so much food. I signed up for coupons. and I hope I get a coupon for the buffet.,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
While this Vegas buffet is the largest; the food itself can be a hit or a mess when it comes to maintenance.  Variety is ever changing to meet the needs of every single person. and that is much appreciated.  My least favorite part of the meal was the carving meats. I had to toughest cut of beef ever. Luckily I had lamb on my plate. and that was edible.  The Asian section is perhaps the best curated section with the most delicious options.  People do come and pile up their plates sky high with crab legs. I’m not sure if buffet restaurants purposely over salt their boiled seafood; unfortunately it was the same here.  The wait staff were phenomenal as not only did the clean quickly but made sure plates were taken and beverages refilled.  Where service lacked was telling paying patrons that someone entered the wrong price at the Kiosk when paying. that the price isn’t $84 and that we’ll have to pay $87 instead.  Do come here if you want to eat your heart out.,5,4,4,5,August 18 2024
An amazing dinner! Always delighted to dine here.,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
Been going to this restaurant every time I’m in Vegas. Love the good quality of food.,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
Overall good. But staffer pushing plate cart ran right into my chair. with me in it.  No apology or acknowldgement.,4,4,3,4,August 17 2024
The food is pretty good for $89 pp. however the ambience is terrible. Truckloads of people dropped off. seemingly like someone gave them a free ticket to pile their plates full of food over and over.  People yelling about the games on like it was a sports bar.  We paid close to $500 for 4 and cannot comprehend how a “nice” place could be so trashy. Will not return. PS we have been going since it was a “room” in the 80s.  Sad.,2,3,4,1,August 17 2024
The dessert buffet was amazing. and the crab was incredibly delicious!,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
No longer offering bottomless mimosas. Prosecco has a 350% mark-up,3,5,5,3,August 17 2024
Food was fire and fresh would go again even tho it pricey worth every cent,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
It was really good we got treated so nicely. and our server was the best this is our 2 time going with the same server and he’s the best,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
We were at this buffet a couple years ago and it was amazing but this time it was NOT worth the $95 we paid for this buffet! The crab legs were always cold. it didn’t matter when we went up there and there were never any full clusters just small parts. The rest of the buffet was just average as well! Was NOT worth the value of what we paid! There were 15 of us and none of us were happy! I don’t think I’ll come back again!,1,1,4,3,August 17 2024
We loved it!  Our waiter was amazing and food was great. Overall great experience.,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
The food options were great! They were even able to accommodate our request to combine our two parties into one table with a 5min wait!,5,5,5,4,August 16 2024
It was a must go to place in the past. BUT this trip there changed a lot. The variety of food is still there. but the quality went down a lot. The worst is that the feeling of food wasting by the servers: they piled a lot of meat items on the counter and made them looks very sad. so were the seafood section which makes the seafood not fresh; and the Asian section as well. I used to like their pork belly a lot. now they are dry and bed looking and I did not even take one. It was a big pile of waste again because no one is taking any. So were the Italian section. salads are wet and soft and cheese are just randomly piled up.… it was just PILE of sadly presented food. The only area that was relatively good was the Mexican food. But for over $90 buffet. it is just NOT GOOD. No wonder the long waiting line is not there any more.,3,3,5,3,August 16 2024
As I come in to check in the lady looks at me up and down and tells me you can’t come in and I said why she said you have to cover up (mind you I had a tub top and shorts on ) she tells me I can go to a boutique and buy something to cover up !  I stated to her absolutely not are you giving me the money to buy and fyi it doesn’t state to dress formal I’m in shorts in tub too this is Vegas 110 degrees weather.  I ask for the manager and he immediately said come in sorry for that I’m like really wow!! As I enter I see serval people dress like me!  The food for price was ok the shrimp was over cooked very soft Mexican food not so good.  Waiters were great always on top of everything!,3,3,5,1,August 16 2024
Amazing but not for 386 for 4 ppl  would have expected more and different food but every time we come it’s the same.,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
The variety was absolutely amazing! There were so many tasty dishes. It was so difficult to narrow it down to the items You really wanted to try. Everything looked delicious. The bananas foster crêpe was freshly made at the crêpe bar. It was the best crêpe I’ve ever had.,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
It was a good experience to try once but not multiple times. The main thing why is was good was the crab legs but the rest of the food was good but not exceptional. Plus the price is high.,4,3,3,2,August 16 2024
No need for a reservation. save your energy. They had us stand in the same line as those who didn’t have a reservation. Good food choices. I loved the lechon! The bone marrow was overrated unless I had a bad batch. The service was mediocre nothing bad to say but nothing amazing stood out. Overall had a good experience and left full AF.,3,4,2,4,August 16 2024
This buffet was amazing. It had everything you could want to eat. from prime rib to Lobster. I would recommend to all family members. Must have reservations to dine there.,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
We had a large group that got seat quickly and the food was good,5,5,4,5,August 16 2024
I made reservations a few weeks before our visit but when in line there were people in front of us that didn't have reservations but went in first before us. so no reason to make reservations in advance.,3,3,4,3,August 16 2024
Lobster claws made it worth it. but be ready. it's pricey!,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
Do not I repeat do not waste your money on this expensive meal. All the food was ok at best. We felt really bad for wasting so much food because every time we went and tried something else it was bad/ok.,1,1,2,2,August 16 2024
Sorry. Ceasars Bacchanal Buffet was the bedt buffet 10 years ago but the last couples of years. the quality of food especially seafood section went down hill like the Wynn Buffet too. We are so disappointed. Never going back. Price charged doesn't match the quality of food displayed. Please concentrate on quality not quantity of food.,3,2,2,4,August 16 2024
My niece came from Korea. So we decided to go buffet. I checked it was number one buffet in Las Vegas. Food was not really fresh I think leftovers from brunch? Waiter was not available when we needed  Not worth it at all Wasted of money  definitely  I should just go a fancy restaurant .,2,1,2,2,August 15 2024
The seafood is not fresh. the sushi and poke is not fresh. I have been here 4 times. this time. it is very bad. I am really disappointed. The food quality has gone down a lot.,1,1,5,4,August 15 2024
It was one of the worst buffet that I’ve ever have. We came in a group of 4 adult and 2 kids( 3 yo- 6 yo) We paid for $450.00. It was overpriced.  We will not come back.,3,3,3,3,August 15 2024
We are Las Vegas locals and were celebrating a birthday.  I thought to make this a special meal that would be different and special. so we went to the Bacchanal Buffet.  This buffet is too expensive for half the price.  The food was cold that should of been hot. on many serving locations.  There were no proper utensils for breaking the crab and no extra cleaning napkins or towels were offered or given it was made clear to only take 90 minutes for our meal.  The food was not kept clean which brought concern when the buffet was at half full capacity.  The quality of meat was average (tough and too fatty) and the cuts were generous (a plus).  Lots of choices in the buffet line but everything was average to below average.  Out plates were taken after use in a good manner.  Perhaps I should be glad that the food was mediocre so that I would not eat too much.  Checking in was very well done with no waiting.  The entrance staff was cheerful and guided us to the proper location for making payment.  The Bacchanal Buffett-Caesars Palace Las Vegas was not that different or special.  Go somewhere else and get a far better meal and service.  I do not recommend this buffet to anyone.....,3,3,3,2,August 15 2024
Crowed. waiters did not clean the tables. Food ok but not great for the cost we paid,3,3,3,2,August 15 2024
Was not good. $300 for 3 people. The brisket and other steamship meats were so dry no juice. The only thing that was good was the street tacos and tri tip Server kept for getting my girlfriends drink witch was water. We said something  and she told us that If we don't like the service we can leave.,1,2,1,2,August 15 2024
This buffet offers great quality of food and service. Abundance of seafood choices (snow crab legs were the best!) It was a little pricey but Bacchanal provides much better value than The Buffet at Wynn in terms of variety as well as quality. Highly recommend.,5,4,5,4,August 15 2024
Sorry folks. this is an overrated buffet.  Not certain what the hype was about.  Salmon on risotto was the best item there.  Oh. let’s not forget the $35 parking.  Wowsers! If you want to pay $90 PP for meh food. go for it folks!  1st and last. LOL!,1,1,5,1,August 15 2024
The prime rib and brisket were dry.  Nothing was hot enough. so the entire meal was eaten cold-even when just going up for one item and returning right away to the table.   I am not a vegetarian. but be warned if you are-very few vegetables.  The best thing about the meal was the dessert table. in particular. the pineapple upside down cake and chocolate chip cookies. if not for them. I would have rated the food as one star.  Our server was friendly and our plates were cleared quickly.  Way too much money and rude employees at registration.,1,2,3,1,August 15 2024
Brilliant buffet. It’s a little pricy but worth every cent. Food was outstanding quality and service was first class. You have 1.5 hours but we were well and truly “done” in about 1 hour. It was a great way to start the evening before going to The Killers concert. Will be going back when in Las Vegas again.,5,5,5,5,August 15 2024
There was a lot of food options available. The main star of the buffet is the steamed snow crabs. The rest of the seafood didn’t taste as nice. The hot foods tasted great although I didn’t have the capacity to try everything. The drawback was the 90mins they placed on you. I think for the amount I pay the time limit needs to be increased or lifted. I have been buffet in Singapore that have the same number of food options with a cheaper price point and better food quality with no time limit.,4,4,4,4,August 14 2024
IMO seafood wasn’t very fresh for the cost. Overly priced. I didn’t have the brisket. but my hubby said The brisket was very dry. The best part of the buffet was the dessert. lots of variety and the mini size sweets were perfect.,3,2,4,3,August 14 2024
Wonderful selection with excellent presentation for a Buffet style dining experience.,5,5,4,5,August 14 2024
The prime rib was great. The Asian food selection was delicious.   Mexican fusion was fantastic.  The seafood was flavorful.  My server was also very attentive in askhow my meal was and getting me refills on my drinks.  After eating so much I still got some deserts I took so many deserts that I forgot what flavors each of them was.  I told myself to start with the coffee flavored one was it could have a slight bitter after taste and it did.  Though I ate that one as the final piece due to my forgetting to the order I was going to eat them after I sat down.,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
My experience is that you pay a lot of money and it is not worth it. I am not a crab or fish person. Overal it looked amazing and the were a lot of choices. The food is not warm enough en it’s cold when you are back at your table. We did it once but will not do it again,3,3,4,3,August 14 2024
Very nice food. surprising quality for a buffet. Meat. seafood and desserts were outstanding. Servers were friendly. Presentation and selection were amazing. Even with a reservation entering restaurant seemed a little chaotic. Price is very high for a buffet. but you will most definitely have a great meal.,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
I booked my reservation and also mentioned that it was my anniversary. No mention of it they sat us in the sun I asked to be seated somewhere else just as awful. The rip tip and brisket was cold not even room temperature. I ate at the Asian side cause that food was cooked and put out hot.  This place used to be good now it’s horrible!!,2,1,3,3,August 14 2024
Other than the steamed snow crab legs and having a large selection of food… this buffet is overhyped. over rated. and over priced.  The hostesses and waiters were not happy. not rude. but definitely not happy to be there. The staff behind the counter were very friendly and smiling.  The carpeted area was pretty dirty. they didn’t clean under our table before being seated and there was a desert plate and a lobster claw.  I enjoyed the steamed crab legs and the pasta made to order. Most of the other food was just not that good… extremely disappointing.  For almost $100 pp we felt ripped off and left unsatisfied with this buffet experience. Should have went to the Wynn Buffet or just had a really nice dinner at a standard restaurant for the same price.  It’s listed as the best buffet in Vegas on so many sites. Probably due to the selection of items. not the quality or overall experience. I do NOT recommend this Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace.,2,3,1,2,August 14 2024
Amazing selections to choose from ! Come hungry cause the deserts are 10/10,5,5,5,5,August 13 2024
You will be harassed here if you show any cleavage. Although their site doesn’t mention a dress code. nor does Caesar’s palace as a whole. you still won’t be allowed to eat here and will be shamed.,1,1,1,1,August 13 2024
Vast array of food choices. There is something for everyone. My personal favorite this trip were the freshly grilled street tacos.  A bit pricey compared to other Vegas buffets. but clearly superior when it comes to service and food quality.,5,5,5,5,August 13 2024
Overpriced and too crowded.  There are tons of high quality restaurants in which one can get a good meal for less than this buffet.  Some of the food was really good. but some were poorly seasoned or over seasoned.  Unless you like crab legs. you're not going to get your money's worth here.,3,3,3,2,August 13 2024
La comida es excelente. el Servicio queda a deber. tal vez porque hay demasiada gente,5,5,4,5,August 13 2024
Great to have reservation and did not have to wait for long long line. Foods selection was great! Worth the price. 90 mins to eat. Chairs was uncomfortable. sink cushion. I guess too many people used it. Service was okay. had to find server for water and drinks. During the time while eating was better. but no wet ones for dirty seafoods hands. At Cashier was asked to include 18. 20 or 22 % tips. not comfortable with paying advance. Overall. it was better than other buffets in Las Vegas. Will come again when visiting Vegas.,4,5,3,3,August 12 2024
Glad we had a reservation. but don’t understand why a buffet is reservation only.  Saw several people turned away.,4,4,5,4,August 12 2024
We were there with two Kids and the food was awesome.,5,5,5,4,August 12 2024
Food was great. Absolutely not worth the price. no buffet is worth those prices.,5,5,3,5,August 12 2024
I fully believe it is worth the price! Amazing food for even the pickiest of eaters (aka me) Yes you pay almost $100 per person but it’s worth it to have a guaranteed good meal & dessert. Never too long of a line & fast drink service. Highly recommend!!,5,5,5,5,August 12 2024
The food quality is not good enough compared with the high price. A lot of food is trashed.,1,2,1,4,August 12 2024
Go before 9pm for a greater experience. The shut food down at 10:30 and you wait in line even with a reservation.,4,4,4,5,August 12 2024
I was very disappointed with the food we came for my husbands 40th birthday to be honest I thought it was a lot of money & the food was poor quality the meat was very fatty & lobster & sea food didn’t taste very fresh,2,1,3,2,August 12 2024
Amazing buffet but don’t understand the point of making a reservation if you still have to wait. We made a 6:30 reservation because we had 8 people and still had to wait over 30 minutes. what is the purpose of the reservation system?,3,5,4,4,August 12 2024
It was overhyped. The food was mainly cold and the flavors could have been better in my opinion.,3,2,3,2,August 12 2024
This was our first time at the Bacchanal. for the price we our expectations were high. The Crab was terrible. and the rest of the food was consistent with other buffet’s that cost less.,3,4,3,3,August 11 2024
Food was good. Dessert was okay. Service was good.,4,4,5,5,August 11 2024
It’s pricey I went for Sunday brunch Some of the food are not fresh,3,3,4,4,August 11 2024
This was a waste of money. Best part of this experience was the asian food. Honestly. the hype for seafood was not worth the 80 bucks we paid per person.,4,3,5,3,August 11 2024
The food quality is not as before anymore … If you never been. you are welcome to try.,3,3,5,5,August 11 2024
Making a reservation is the only way to do it.  The host checked us in quickly.  We paid easily and were guided to table.  Basically. close to 0 wait time.    Great food.  So worth the money and effort.  And the service was outstanding!,5,5,5,5,August 11 2024
Variety of food was very good but quality suffered. Out of everything tried only 3 savory dishes were better than average and one dessert. 50/50 on staff being very friendly or completely indifferent.,3,3,3,3,August 11 2024
Great experience  and great food. Attentive staff,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
Was not a good value at all compared to wicked spoon which has better tasting food and costs half the price ￼,3,3,5,4,August 10 2024
It was a bit pricey since we went on the weekend. For about $100 per head. not sure if it’s worth it. It should have been $50 maximum - food was all fresh but nothing was outstanding apart from one dessert. Great staff - our server was incredible! we probably won’t do it again at that price but I suppose it was an experience we had to have.,3,3,4,4,August 10 2024
Wide variety of dishes with good quality. but don't expect delicacy.,4,4,4,4,August 10 2024
It was our first time dining here. we came for brunch. There were plenty of different food options and the service was great.,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
The most food i want to eat for this buffet is crab. but after we buy the tickets. we find out we only have one and half hours to eat. that was shortest time we ever had for buffet. and very disappointed that i don't have enough time to enjoy my food.,3,3,4,4,August 10 2024
No prices displayed anywhere so we were a little surprised that a buffet was going to cost us $90 plus tax each. extra for alcohol.  We booked a table at 8.45pm and then had to stand in a queue for another 15 minutes to be seated.  The atmosphere was not good. the food was nice. but you had to line up for everything. so it took ages to get anything.  I would say that if you like seafood it’s the place to go and try everything. I wouldn’t go again.,3,3,4,1,August 10 2024
Food was great so many options. Come hungry or you will not get your moneys worth,5,5,4,5,August 10 2024
Lots of options. but not the best in taste. Dry brisket. undercooked pork belly. bland sushi. Seafood bar was decent.,3,3,5,3,August 10 2024
Everything was great even for those with allergies as we had. Would definitely recommend and come again. If i had to complain the meat was overdone but understandable as well as it is a Buffet,5,4,5,5,August 10 2024
Definitely need to experience this buffet at least once. Well worth it.,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
Great love the deserts so many options. My husband loved the meat station said everything was great,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
The crab legs were outstanding!!! Even though the price seems high. it was worth every penny!Everything was delicious and I plan to get every time I’m in Vegas. I highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
I think it depends what you go there for. My daughter loves crab legs so she had a 6 plates of steamed crab legs. My  bonus mom loved the prime rib. I liked the brisket and deserts. Do I feel it was worth $90. I’m still on the fence about that. It was a family dinner for 8 and they sat us quick and our server was Amazing. In Vegas you are really paying for the experience. And it was an experience.,4,4,5,5,August 9 2024
The variety of options is good. but for the price you may expect much more. Also the. taste of the food was average at most. One of our party members felt sick immediately after finishing eating. so. considering the aboved mentioned cost. the experience is not recommendable,3,2,4,4,August 9 2024
Great top tier buffet. great service. great food and i couldnt say much else. It was stellar,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
They should keep the crab legs whole instead of breaking the legs individually for the warmed crab legs! We paid over $250. stop being cheap about it.,3,4,4,4,August 9 2024
Portions was great. food was amazing and it’s worth the price.,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Amazing and excellent venue all around!  I recommend it worth the price!,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Food is exceptional always worth it.  High price point but worth it if they don’t rush you,4,5,4,3,August 9 2024
I absolutely love the staff dedication. and the authenticity of the food,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
The buffet has a lot of options to choose from but it is not worth $85 per person.,3,2,3,5,August 9 2024
Excelente variedad de comidas. para todos los gustos. Nunca falto algo. Se destaca la atención del Personal de cocina y mozos. atentos todo el tiempo.,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
A table server was mean because of the tip. The experience of Bacchanal Buffet was bad owing to her.,2,3,1,1,August 9 2024
A very expensive buffet but the food does not meet the price expectations,3,2,5,4,August 9 2024
The food was amazing there is so much to choose from. literally something for everyone.  Would highly recommend a reservation and still expect a 20-30 minute wait in line,5,5,4,5,August 9 2024
They asked for the occasion and they gave us a round table that would fit everyone. Very nice.,5,5,4,5,August 9 2024
Excellent selection! Great quality worth the money and experience.,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Overall it’s an incredible buffet. just wish it was slightly more affordable.,4,5,5,5,August 8 2024
The food and service were great.  It's just a little pricy from the last time I was there.,5,4,5,5,August 8 2024
Incredible as always!!! Every time I come to Vegas. I make sure to stop by. And I'll be back again next time!,5,5,5,5,August 8 2024
I recently dined at the buffet at Caesar Plaza and found the overall experience to be mediocre. The selection of seafood was limited. and although the beef looked appealing. it was tough and hard to chew. The Asian food section was decent.but considering the quality. the price felt quite high.,3,3,4,3,August 8 2024
Pretty good food. Way over priced for brunch. Waitress brought one refill of drinks. Overall 3/5 experience. Had worse had better.,3,3,3,3,August 8 2024
I would not recommend this place if you are in search for a great buffet. A lot of items not included in the buffet price. (Bait and switch) Food not freshly displayed. Buffet restaurant lacks customer service. Addressed issues to restaurant manager and he pretty much didn't care.,2,2,2,3,August 8 2024
Génial ! À faire absolument. Très belle découverte.,5,5,5,5,August 8 2024
The seafood was amazing. That was the main reason I went. They have lobster. King crab. blue crabs. clams. mussels etc.  If you are a seafood lover you will be in  heaven!!!  It costs more than other buffets about $190 for 2 people but it's well worth it.  They do limit your time to only 90 minutes.   So plan and eat accordingly.,5,5,4,4,August 8 2024
Lots of good and selection. I can’t eat a lot too really get my moneys worth but I love the options. good place to try while visiting but definitely not something to eat all the time,4,4,4,5,August 8 2024
Great food. The servers need to clear plates Out quicker. No crab leg tools available. Had to ask. Had to ask for straws. Gave a good tip before we paid however service was not up to par and not worth the tip provided.  The hostess at the front were pleasant and made the lines move quickly.,5,5,3,5,August 8 2024
The food was great and there was an amazing selection.  It was very pricy and there's no way we could eat our money's worth.  But we were paying for the experience. We had to wait in line for almost 30 minutes WITH a reservation.    It was sometimes hard to get to the buffet because there were just too many people there. It's great to do once but I wouldn't do it again.,4,4,4,3,August 8 2024
Jose at the seafood station has great customer service skills. I work for a major airline and I know that great service brings people back.,5,5,5,3,August 8 2024
Food was amazing as always. It does get a bit loud but overall it was an incredible dinner..,5,5,5,5,August 8 2024
Food was good but price tag was extremely expensive. Had to flag down servers for more drinks.,5,5,3,5,August 7 2024
Pros: Great service at our table and the food was lovely. Cons: Very busy and expensive.,4,5,5,5,August 7 2024
Good food. good service . every time we visit Las Vegas we always go there for food,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
Los alimentos en general no me parecieron con un buen sabor. creo que han bajado su calidad.,5,4,5,5,August 7 2024
I would’ve gave it a better rating had it not been for one of the butchers that would not make my girlfriends meat more well done. even though they clearly had the technology to do it. He was seemingly very moody and my girlfriend pretty much lost her appetite and I felt awful for wasting over $100 on her buffet cost. She lost her appetite after he was so disgruntled about being asked to make meat well done. Luckily. for us. one of the other butchers gladly did it for her. but at that point. she was already pretty let down. If it wasn’t for that. I think we would’ve had an amazing experience. Unfortunately. the rest of the dinner Experience was pretty much a drag after that. This might be my first or second review I have ever done. Otherwise. the food quality was pretty good. the servers were pretty nice and the hostess at the entry was really sweet. She wanted to talk to the manager. but I told her it wasn’t worth it. I hope whoever reads this will talk to the butchers about being requested to cook the meat a little bit more well done for the guests that pay over $100 for this experience. There’s a perfect burning oven and stove behind the butchers area that I am sure is used for those kinds of requests.,4,4,2,3,August 7 2024
Not worth the money. The crab legs are separated and precracked making them dry and flavorless,3,1,5,2,August 7 2024
The seafood and desserts were amazing! The meats looked good but were dry. Service was good but slow because of the volume of patrons. Overall a great place to visit!,4,4,4,4,August 7 2024
Food was mostly delicious. lobster claws were dry and had no flavor. too bad there were no lobster tails. Value wise it’s not worth it for us. but it’s a good one time experience.,3,4,4,4,August 6 2024
Felt like I was eating at a wearhouse. I highly recommend for a first time experience but I wouldn’t come back. I ate at the Wynn buffet. I enjoyed eating at the Wynn buffet alote more.,3,3,5,2,August 6 2024
Food was mediocre at best.. not worth the price of admission.. best to find another place to enjoy,3,3,5,4,August 6 2024
Used to be really good. but not money worth it any more. We waited 30 plus minutes to get in WITH reservation. Food quality was absolutely graded down. Waitress was rude and took forever to bring drinks. A worker & crape station was absolutely rude with attitude. I want full refunds. It’s that bad.,1,1,1,1,August 6 2024
"""Why are they forcing me to pay a tip at a buffet? They made me pay a tip when I entered. I said I didn't want to. but they insisted that I have to pay it. Is it normal to be forced to pay a tip at a buffet?""",4,5,1,1,August 6 2024
Very good buffet. Lots of choices. Crab legs were ok at best. Carving station was ok. Excellent service. Deserts were incredible. We wouldn’t go back but glad we gave it a try!,5,5,5,4,August 6 2024
Absolutely no service. check in with a reservation is a mess. So many workers standing there but you are directed to a machine to check in and pay. Tip is required before you even eat. Lots of food options but taste is mediocre. Highlight is the seafood. But nothing about this buffet is worth the $85 per person they charge.,3,2,1,3,August 6 2024
Don’t believe the internet when they says it’s $42 on weekdays. It’s always $90- something a person. Several people in line were all shocked when it wasn’t the advertised price. Be prepared for lots of selections to be empty as it’s VERY busy. Some things are amazing- bao buns. hamachi. porchetta and the tacos. Some things are a total miss- dessert. a few dishes and most of the seafood is unseasoned/just boiled and extremely overdone (the salmon and polenta I’m looking at you). Be aware. you’re going to literally get shoved out of the way by influencers live streaming the buffet line for idiots who want to watch them eating from home. Tons of kids screaming/crying. I wish they’d had an adults only seating area. For $100/person I would have loved to not sit next to 12 crying babies who were performing their own aria. Seating is cramped. Service is amazing. Soda options are limited. Dining area is nice but all in all this is an expensive and very fancy Golden Corral lacking some imagination.,4,3,5,4,August 6 2024
We have been here before but the selection of American food seemed decreased and the service at the table wasn’t as good,4,3,3,4,August 6 2024
If you’re on the hunt for an exceptional dining experience. look no further. This buffet truly stands out as one of the best I’ve encountered. From the moment I walked in. I was impressed by the variety and quality of the offerings. Each dish was not only delicious but also beautifully presented. reflecting a high level of culinary expertise.  The selection was extensive. with options ranging from fresh salads and gourmet cheeses to perfectly cooked meats and an array of decadent desserts. However. the highlight was definitely the seafood. The variety and quality of the seafood were truly amazing. with every item showcasing freshness and superb flavor.  If you’re considering this buffet. do yourself a favor and go for it. It’s not just a meal; it’s a celebration of great food and an exceptional seafood experience. Highly recommended!,5,5,5,5,August 5 2024
Everything is good. Especially for line when you booking with OpenTable. more convenient than anything else.,5,4,5,5,August 5 2024
I het that all the buffets are over priced in Vegas but this one should get a special disclaimer for what a rip off it is.   Brisket was standout but that’s it.  Crummy little snow crab legs. they literally throw at you. are nothing great.  The 3 of us paid a combined $210 for brunch.  Wicked spoon is better food and better value at Cosmo.,2,3,3,3,August 5 2024
It was something to experience but for breakfast it is expensive. There is a lot of variety as you would expect from a buffet on the strip. Personally I probably should have done either the lunch or dinner.,3,4,4,3,August 5 2024
Amazing place. Amazing food. Amazing service. A must-do in Vegas. Traditional and friendly.,5,5,5,5,August 5 2024
Not worth the 60$ buffett . options very limited .,1,1,5,5,August 5 2024
Wow the people that lead you in and check your reservation at the front were the rudest. meanest. and clueless people I’ve ever dealt with. I usually won’t reach out and ask for help/questions because of my social anxiety. I tried asking if this was the correct line and was ignored after she looked at me. I continued standing there waiting to be acknowledged. There was another person chatting with a coworker and another standing doing nothing. I kept waiting then just spoke past the person I was waiting for to the person doing nothing. She was very friendly but like why didn’t she save me from either of her other rude workers earlier!? That’s how it started. Got peeved after that but just waited in line. After we go through the line we are lead back and forth. Asked how many were in our party when it was on the reservation and we already spoke to them about it. Then told us to go to another spot. We weren’t behind a rope or something but we went to the spot they pointed but she seemed annoyed we couldn’t read her mind. Anyways it was just a mess and nobody seemed to know what they were doing. We were so confused and put off and one of us heard that the woman helping us called us rude under her breath when we were just super confused at what we were supposed to do. Then once seated the waiters weren’t outright rude like the people at the start but they weren’t exactly friendly either. Food was fine but night was ruined before we ate any. We are all incredibly polite and weren’t drunk or anything. So when you are just confused and being treated so badly we are just like is it us??? What did we do to deserve this treatment? It was our first time here and two of us had never been to Vegas ever. Not a great first experience.,1,4,1,1,August 5 2024
Even with reservation you have to wait for 2 hours to get in. this place has bunch of employees that don’t care about customers. rude. yelling at customers. it was a mess. Horrible experience,1,1,1,1,August 5 2024
Great experience. They timed us for 90 minutes and gave us reminder around 1 hour.,5,5,5,5,August 5 2024
It was ok. Nothing was really good  except brisket,3,2,3,2,August 5 2024
I’m a foodie and Bacchanal was a buffet I’ve been wanting to try for years and I’m so disappointed. I love seafood but it wasn’t worth the hassle. If you’re going for the crab DON’T!!! You can just go to red lobster because the quality was the same. Also. I grabbed a few kimchi oysters and when I got back to my table I realized only the kimchi sauce was inside the shell and no oyster. The food quality was horrible. Service was great. The only thing that was decent was the birria tacos and a few pieces of sushi. SAVE YOUR money!! There are so many great restaurants in Vegas that are 10X better than Bacchanal!! Tiktok lied this place was not good!! LOL,1,1,4,2,August 4 2024
It was wonderful! We will go back when we are in vegas again.  Highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
Great food and service. as always has a variety of selections. see you next time,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
Loved it! Everything was great! Great experience. great food!,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
Servers food was amazing. make sure to make reservations,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
This is my second visit to the buffet and I did quite enjoy the experience.  The choices are endless and the dessert area was so colorful. it was beautiful.  My only complaint was the shrimp with the heads on was so overcooked that they were just about mush inside. I also thought if you had a platinum players card the buffet was discounted. Just those small complaints I'm sorry one more thing the organization of the wait lines was absolutely confusing and that was because of staff. I was placed in a line with another couple and no one came to help us. we to ask someone after 10 minutes why we were stillstanding there. I was also put in a line with people who had no reservation but I had one. As I said it was confusing.,4,4,5,3,August 4 2024
Great Buffett. No complaints. Don’t eat the day prior to going and you’ll be fine.,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
Sabor repetido porciones muy pequeñas. servicio del mesero con actitud molesta,1,2,1,5,August 4 2024
A lot of choices for a buffet. Quality of food was high. Should have more fish and seafood. Some soft drinks and fruit juices included which is great. A bit overpriced.,4,4,5,4,August 4 2024
The food selection. flavor and quality was outstanding. They serve Lobster Claws instead of Tails and Snow Crab instead of King Crab so the value wasn’t great and they don’t validate for parking (Parking = $35 Saturday). I’ve been to Casinos locally here in Southern California that serve Lobster Tails and King Crab for $20 less per person with free parking. so the value at Bacchanal isn’t great. but the food is delicious and the variety is excellent.,4,5,4,5,August 4 2024
Great place to eat if you're super hungry. There is a variety of food selections to satisfy every craving. Even though my party was 30 minutes late. they still accommodated us.,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
Waited thirty minutes even though we had a reservation.  Never saw a server.  Caesar’s has raised the price but cut the value and service,1,4,1,1,August 4 2024
Very dry meat. Asian selection was average. Excellent items were prime rib (others were dry) and snow crab. The furniture felt dirty and a little dated. Otherwise fun experience and atmosphere to try one time.,3,3,4,4,August 4 2024
I haven’t been here before Covid. so I wasn’t sure what to expect. We have the best server. Michael. he went above and beyond with his best service! He always checked up on us. made small convos with us and was quick to get old plates out of the way and refill our drinks all the time. We were a party of 8 and he held it down. He saw that we were singing happy birthday to someone on our table. he went out of his way and made his own dessert plate with “happy birthday” written on it and grabbed a team to sing happy birthday. The food was great. the price is kinda high. but if you eat 2-3 rounds of crab legs and a few more plates of everything else.. it’s worth the price.,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
All the proteins were dry excluding the prime rib. The salt level on a majority of items were too heavy. Overall. the place has such a large variety but missing the quality,2,2,5,5,August 4 2024
Selections is definitely less than The buffet at Wynn. Service is good,4,4,5,4,August 4 2024
We come every time we’re in Vegas for special occasions.,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
I believe my party had a grand time. They loved the Photo very much. loved the crab and lobster claws also the prime rib was good. Soda was flat.,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
Was wonderful. Food personal perfect. I doing every time visit Vegas,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
Excelente variedad de alimentos y buena calidad de los mismos. Sin espera en cada seccion a pesar de la infinita cantidad de gente.,5,5,5,3,August 3 2024
La verdad. las meseras son groseras. Discuten contigo por cualquier cosa y hay limite de tiempo. Está demasiado caro para lo que es.,4,4,3,5,August 3 2024
We wanted to try the Bacchanal Buffet for their crab legs. What we didn’t expect that there were hot crab legs. cold crab legs. lobster claws. scallops. the lists goes on!!! It was an amazing experience!,5,5,5,4,August 3 2024
My family and I had to wait in line for longer than we were supposed to. We had a reservation but had to wait for the staff to let other people without reservations to come in first. We had small kids which made the wait worse since they were hungry and acted up. I had to raise my voice and asked to be seated so then they let me in. Such a bad experience with the prize I paid for my whole family.  But our server is great!,3,4,3,3,August 3 2024
Pricey for the quality of food. Felt like I was paying more for the presentation than anything else,3,2,5,5,August 3 2024
This is my second time and it was GREAT. When we come back to Vegas we will surely return,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
Best buffet in Vegas. A must try if you’ve never been,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
For the price of $88+ per person to eat at this buffet. you are definitely not getting your money's worth.  All the seafood were overcooked and dried. I recall trying the Dungeness crab and it so dry and did not have any of the sweet fresh seafood taste as you would expect.  Dessert was nothing special.  In general. the quality of the food is just not up to par for the price you pay and the long wait to get into it.  90% of the food was too dry. too salty. or too sweet (for dessert).  We would definitely not go back again. nor would we recommend this restaurant to any of our family and friends.  There is a lot more and better selection to eat from in Vegas than this place.,2,1,3,2,August 3 2024
The food was mostly catered to the foreign nationals.  The variety didn’t appeal to us because the food appeared to be packaged food.,3,3,4,4,August 3 2024
This place was awful! The food was terrible! With having a reservation we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated !,1,1,1,1,August 3 2024
The food is great. once you get inside. The check in process and waiting period needs to be totally revamped. Why require reservations just to wait in line for an undetermined amount of time. The waiting area is small & crowded and very hectic. Service was amazing. Staff were amazing! Just the wait time was the only downside.,4,4,5,4,August 3 2024
Great quality food and tons of it. My only concerns is that I wasn't able to try everything... and I had over 3 plates of food!,5,5,4,3,August 3 2024
Great everytime. never disappoints. Crab legs for days!!! Love all the options. there something for everyone.,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
Such an amazing experience. I'm telling everyone I know about this place,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
My favorite place whenever my family go to Las Vegas!! My kids love it. The foods are good. When You make reservations they take you in right away.,5,5,5,5,August 2 2024
Todo está riquísimo  gracias por tantas atenciones,5,5,5,5,August 2 2024
Great food and awesome layout. We had a great time,5,5,5,5,August 2 2024
The food was subpar. The peel shrimp was mush and most of the sea food was served cold.  Was not a pleasant at all.,1,1,4,3,August 2 2024
There is a such a huge choice of buffets in vegas but this one always seems to be our favourite. A huge range of different dinning options. I would recommend booking in advance to save you having to queue to get in and definitely go on an empty stomach. My favourite food was the crab legs. Only downside is for the price nowadays you need to eat a lot to beat the buffet. and it does not include drinks.,4,4,5,4,August 2 2024
The incredible selection of food left me speechless...everything was amazing and our server. Annette. was so kind and friendly to us!,5,5,5,5,August 2 2024
Michael was an excellent server! So pleasant! This buffet is consistent as well as we have been 5 times in the past few years.,5,5,5,5,August 1 2024
Lots of food options. So we’re better than others but overall the food was food. Crab legs were not too salty.  FYI…Crepes are at the dessert station.,5,4,4,4,August 1 2024
This all you can eat buffet was really nice and there are a lot of food options. It was definitely worth the money.,5,5,5,5,August 1 2024
El mejor bufete de Las Vegas. vale cada dollar que pagas!!,5,5,5,5,August 1 2024
Server was great! The food was cold and bland. Not worth I hype we have been hearing or the price!,1,1,3,2,August 1 2024
"Repeat visit to Bacchanal...Miss seeing GM Roman. but enjoyed the exceptional greeting and care by Supervisor Erica. and a visit with Chef Roman and the great service by Ramona...it was an ""R"" day filled with great food and wonderful hospitality. as one might expect from Caesars.  Add to it the REMARKABLE energized spirit of this Wonderful English accented Gentleman serving the Crab Legs with such hospitality and welcome......WOW!   I forgot his name. but he is always amazing and engaging!  And far be it for me to forget ROBERT serving the gelato with the enthusiasm and smile AS NO OTHER GELATO CART IN THE ENTIRE CITY OF LAS VEGAS.....lets just say he is second to none. as we look forward to seeing him EVERY VISIT EVERY YEAR!  Thank you Roman. Ramona. and Robert!!!! (If GM Roman knows the English gentleman I speak of. please let me know his name!)",5,5,5,4,August 1 2024
Most of the seafood was on the cold bar. They had lobster claws nut no tails. I prefer the buffet at Bellagio.,3,2,5,5,August 1 2024
Very good all around! Was able to try different things that normally do not eat regularly!,5,5,5,5,August 1 2024
The Snow crab legs were small. unlike our previous visits.  We were very disappointed.   The service was good.  We were seated way in the back for the first time and it was cold. even with many people in there.    We drive down from Utah quite regularly and always visit there. but it was really not up to the standard we've been used to.,3,3,5,4,July 31 2024
Best quality buffet in Vegas. Top notch food. You won’t be disappointed even though it’s rather expensive.,5,5,4,3,July 31 2024
The food was good. but aftertax and tip. the buffet was $107. I live in Texas. so maybe things just cost more…but $107 for one person is excessive. in my opinion.,4,3,5,4,July 31 2024
We went there for the beef.  The prime rib. cooked medium rare was tough. the tri-tip was only cooked medium well and so tough. you could not cut it. We were extremely disappointed.  There also is no traditional salad bar. which was also a let down.  Yes there is a lot of variety but even for sea food lovers. the stench of fish smell was a turn off.  For three people. it cost 277.00.  Unfortunately. due to the restaurants availability for quality beef. we will not return.,2,2,3,2,July 31 2024
Horrible service . Despite having reservations waited additional 45 min. People in line were going ahead of us with no reservations.when we were finally seated it was in a very tight spot,1,1,1,1,July 31 2024
I don't know why they take reservations. I had to wait a very long time to get in.,4,5,3,5,July 31 2024
Went to several Vegas buffets this week. This one was by far. the worst.  The line was chaos. the floor was chaos.  No way in hell this place is worth $100 apiece. Wynn was so much better than this dump! Bachanal was more on par with South Point or Luxor. than the Palms or Wynn!!  The set-up. the service. and the food were all bad!! Hit ANY other buffet in Vegas. not this rip-off,1,1,1,1,July 31 2024
It was fine but there was no point to a reservation they still put you in the back of the line . Like a walk in but the food was amazing ￼,5,5,5,4,July 31 2024
It is so much that it is hard to decide. The crab legs are very popular and they are good. The brisket and prime rib are five star. We enjoyed it.,4,4,5,4,July 31 2024
I think it is Overprice and lobster is little too dry,3,3,3,3,July 31 2024
Not at all worth the $$ My sister & I were so excited to eat at “the best buffet on the strip” everything we ate was very bland. Prawns were mushy. snow crab was just okay. Birra tacos bland. desserts bland . we did like the chicken & prime rib that was at least decent. Our waitress Maria was outstanding. With so many disappointments bite after bite we wished we would have returned to the awesome street tacos we had the night before across the street . Now those were worth every penny. So sorry Caesars  just not worth $104 for decent chicken.,2,1,5,5,July 30 2024
Great and very good food . te service is great and the experience is amazing,4,4,5,5,July 30 2024
I highly recommend eating here. You definitely get your money’s worth.,5,4,4,5,July 30 2024
the ladies in the front checking people in so rude but our actual waiter was AMAZING!!! the food was bomb!,3,5,2,5,July 30 2024
Vast array (over 200) of good food choices. The quality of the food was by far better than what you expect from buffet style eating. Our water was excellent. After visiting nearly every other hotel buffet I highly recommend this one! You want be dissatisfied.,5,5,5,5,July 30 2024
Food was not good. lobster was over cooked. Food tasted bland,2,2,3,3,July 30 2024
We went here upon a reccomendation.  We weren’t disappointed.  I highly suggest making a reservation. We had an early time for 430pm and was seated on time. The buffet was busy but not overly crowded. They do give you a time limit of 90 mins. They write your arrival time on your ticket. The service was on point. A server greeted us promptly and brought beverages and our plates were cleared constantly. Never had a dirty dish sitting at the table   The buffet was clean and well taken care of.  The atmosphere was pleasant. The food was always hot & fresh  I recommend walking through the buffet first and looking at what they have to offer as there are so many dishes. Then sample your way through. The food we had was fantastic!  There are several stations. - Asian. Mexican. American. Italian and seafood and of course a dessert station. There was even an antipasto area with fresh breads. meat & cheese. and nuts.  The carving station consisted of prime rib. brisket. tri tip and on another there was pork and turkey. The prime rib was phenomenal. The tri tip and brisket were equally as good.  The seafood station had plenty of seafood. however we don’t eat seafood so I did not venture into that area. I love Mexican food and they had many dishes. I only sampled a few and found them to be a little spicier than I prefer.   The Asian food had all the favorites and then some and the items I tried were delicious.   The dessert station had an action station featuring crepes. You could choose from different toppings and they would make it right there.  They also had a gelato station and many desserts to choose from. They even had gluten free items. Overall we enjoyed our visit and with a time limit added to our dining experience we did not feel rushed. Pricing for this buffet fell in between a range of $50-100.  We went on a Monday evening 430pm and paid $90 per person. If you love buffets this one has something for everyone.and doesn’t disappoint,4,4,5,5,July 29 2024
The waiters had a power trip. we were laughing and minding our business and the waiters were ignoring us when we tried talking to them. Overall they were rude to us a group of 8. The food was outstanding but the service was absolutely terrible. The people seating everyone did not do a good job also.,2,3,1,2,July 29 2024
Over rated and old food. It’s definitely not worth $85.,2,1,2,2,July 29 2024
It was fine. but so expensive for lunch buffet. $287 for three people. Food was good.,4,4,5,5,July 29 2024
Booked on Open Table days in advance. We arrived. and they told me my reservation didn't exist even though I kept showing them my Open Table reservation. I had to escalate for them to honor my reservation.  Food quality has gone way down since the last time I have been here. The other cheaper buffet was par or better in terms of quality and taste. Not worth the $100.,2,3,3,3,July 29 2024
The food and service was excellent! I would recommend it to anyone visiting Las Vegas! ￼,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
The queuing system was crazy! So many lines. very poor instruction from staff. Treated like being in line for a school dinner. with most staff looking annoyed at our presence. Then being asked to tip for that awful experience. The restaurant itself was very busy and noisy but the server was very pleasant. Food was lovely but the queuing etiquette was not adhered to by all patrons which was frustrating. Food was overall at a good standard and the snow crab legs were the star. We would not go again as the atmosphere was awful!!,3,4,2,2,July 29 2024
It was disappointing from pass years the brisket was dry. Not as many options as in pass. When you checked in the host she very rude. Help me make sense of this if we book reservations why people who didn’t get seated before us . So I will not be returning to Bacchanal again,2,2,2,2,July 28 2024
Nos atendió una mesera muy grosera. que como ya casi terminaba su turno. 30 minutos. no nos atendía y cada vez que pedíamos algo nos decía que ya vendría la nueva mesera. Afortunadamente Esmeralda J. Nos empezó a atender y su atención fue excelente. La comida bien. No obstante que teníamos reserva nos tardamos media hora en pasar a sentarnos.,4,5,4,4,July 28 2024
The quality and variety of the savory options were exceptional. Standout dishes include the salt and pepper frog legs. whole roasted pig. birria tacos. ube horchata. prime rib. and chilled seafood. The dessert options were underwhelming though there were a couple standouts like the mini macarons and Oreo tiramisu. The mochi donuts were poorly executed with a heavy. flavorless dough. the crepes were large but overly sweet. and the various cakes and cupcakes were fine but lacked refinement and flavor. Service was very good. Even with a full house. our plates were cleared regularly. and drinks were kept full. The price is borderline unacceptable at $84.99 for a weekend brunch - especially with such a lacking desserts section. But as a splurge. it's worth it for the many savory gourmet options available.,4,4,5,4,July 28 2024
Mr. Davila went out of his way to accommodate our party and ensure that we received excellent customer service.  Food was good and servers kept the line very clean.  Definitely will be back.,4,4,4,4,July 28 2024
There is literally something for everyone here. Picky eaters and fancy eaters are both well served. The hostesses were a little cool. but I'm not sure how I'd handle seating hundreds of people an hour myself. Great variety and excellent quality.,5,5,5,4,July 28 2024
This place must be buying their reviews. It's disgusting and food is definitely not fresh. Not worth $20 let alone $100 per person. Skip this place. Service also is terrible. Waitress will never ask to refill your drink,1,1,1,3,July 28 2024
Great service and excellent food. Will definitely return in the future,5,5,5,5,July 28 2024
Our server was great. The service was fast. The food was excellent.,5,5,5,5,July 28 2024
Amazing Buffet the count of different things was superb.,5,5,5,5,July 28 2024
Tons of options actual food taste was mediocre at best! 30 minute wait with a reservation was also crazy.,3,2,4,5,July 28 2024
The food looks much better than it actually tastes. However. our server. Mike was outstanding!  He is the reason my overall experience was good.   The food was not worth $100 per person.,4,2,5,4,July 28 2024
Big buffet for sure. but more expensive and crowded than others on the strip.,3,4,3,4,July 27 2024
Hands down the best buffet I have ever experienced.,5,5,5,5,July 27 2024
Great buffet experience. Pricey. No salad bar.Lot of seafood selection. Fried frog leg if that is something you’d want to eat,5,5,5,5,July 27 2024
I celebrated my birthday at Bacchannal. and it was fantastic. The elegant ambiance and attentive staff set the stage for an unforgettable night. The buffet was a highlight with its stunning variety—succulent prime rib. fresh seafood. and a delightful dessert spread. The overall experience was exceptional. making it a perfect spot for any special occasion. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in a lavish feast!,5,4,5,5,July 27 2024
Food was good. I wish the butter for the seafood was warm. Only issue was our seating. We went to go get dessert and they cleared off our table and thought we left. Then dat us somewhere else with a different server. The rest of the time we felt like if we got up to get more food they would take our table again.,5,4,3,5,July 27 2024
Oh my goodness. incredible food. outstanding service. wow….amazing!!!,5,5,5,5,July 27 2024
Lots of options and moderately priced for Vegas food but overall it did not feel worth it comparative to other buffets I’ve had. Numerous options including some exotic food so definitely worth checking. More of an experience to say you’ve been then a good value buffet.,3,3,3,3,July 26 2024
It was amazing!! Highly recommend. It’s expensive but fun!,5,5,5,5,July 26 2024
always a great place to eat!!. Food is always amazing. A bit pricy but worth it,5,5,5,5,July 26 2024
Great restaurant highly recommend. customer service was Great! Helped with reservation and food was exquisite. Great food variety and very tasteful. Would recommend it 100%,5,5,5,5,July 26 2024
It was good but very crowded and not sure if worth the overall price,5,4,5,3,July 26 2024
Great food can’t wait to go back. It was busy but the line moved quick. Not much point in making a reservation tho.,4,4,4,3,July 26 2024
pros: The food. atmosphere and the lil 30 minute wait time was pretty good. it was so many good food choices to choose from and that’s what made it worth the while. our waiter was the bomb. this guy was on it from the time we sat down. til the time we left. i was glad to leave him a $20 tip. tip wasn’t a requirement. but we know a good waiter when we see one.   cons: the only thing was missing was lobster tail or some king crab legs. for about $85. we was expecting one or both to be at the buffet.  it was a lot of people and a lot of moving and talking. but i wasn’t nothing to prevent you from having a good ol’ time like my wife and i had. we saw this buffet on one of the food channels a few years ago and we put this on our Vegas trip. overall we had a great time. great experience and some good eating:),5,4,5,4,July 26 2024
Way too crowded. very noisy. seatings are too close for comfort.  Food was ok.  The crab legs were good. The blatant reminder of 90 minutes time limit and the gigantic handwritten time stamp on receipt before being seated felt like they wanted you out of there as soon as possible to bring in all those waiting customers.  The rush is understandable; it just doesn’t work for a welcoming meal.  Came for the experience. probably wont come back.,3,3,3,2,July 26 2024
Great variety on the Buffett. It’s hard to eat enough to get your moneys worth for someone with a small appetite but there is plenty to choose from.,4,4,4,4,July 26 2024
Great fresh food surprisingly found out they make sweets from ube and it’s delicious both at sweets section and as buffet drinks everything fresh and not less than 4.5 star out of 5,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
Everything was outstanding and I can’t wait until my return trip.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
They’re no noodle stations. Not that much seafood selections. For the price  you pay the food is not worth it.,3,3,3,3,July 25 2024
Best value in vegas hands down. 3rd time visiting in 5 years and it's still the best value in town.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
"The whole experience was a complete let down. More like feeding time at the zoo. rather than a high class buffet that claims ""the best just got better"". Far too many people in the space available. The Chinese section was pretty good but the American section with the meats stacked high was a real turn off. My wife and I were very happy to get out of there.",1,2,4,1,July 25 2024
It was an overall good experience. I would go back but not for brunch. I’d try the dinner time menu,5,4,4,5,July 25 2024
Wonderful buffet. Need to watch how long food is under the heaters. as I bit into a couple items (a s’mores waffle and a bao bun) that had dried out and became hard. But the sushi was fabulous. The desserts were delicious. The Oreo tiramisu and tapioca pudding were the best desserts. The menudo was authentic. Skip the pizza.,5,4,5,5,July 25 2024
Large quantity and variety of food.  Food was very bland.   The seafood did not taste sweet at all.  Meat was tough.  If you want quality over quantity look elsewhere.,2,2,4,3,July 25 2024
Service was really good and the food was plentiful. The price tag for this buffet was a bit much. but it was in line with other venues.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
This is an Excellent Buffett “best I have been to” and not to be missed,4,5,4,4,July 25 2024
Das 90min „Timelimit“ führt zu Beginn zu einem hetzten. Die Zeit ist aber mehr als ausreichend!,4,5,3,3,July 25 2024
The food quality was low and below average compared to the price. The food did not taste impressive. There was an incredible amount of noise in the restaurant. and it is definitely not a cozy place. We had a reservation at 9:45 PM. and at 10:30 PM. they started packing up all the food! They claimed that we had been told that we only had an hour for our dinner. but we had not - Who wants to pay full price for such a short time? Terrible service. The restaurant is there for the money and not for quality and service. I/we will not recommend Bacchanal Buffet - Caesars Palace Las Vegas.,1,2,1,1,July 24 2024
I've been there before Covid and once again now! The quality is not the same! Crab legs-over cooked. prawns-waaay overcooked (crumble in your mouth). lobster-overcooked! Definitely not what we expected especially for the money you pay! I wish we could've been compensated for all of that!,2,1,3,2,July 24 2024
The overall experience was poor from start to finish. Firstly rush to table with no explanation of buffet set up. The chicken  and turkey were so dry they were difficult to eat. The pork ribs were like rubber and very fatty. Struggled to cut meat off the ribs. They were not tender at all. The vegetables were awful . The desserts and ice cream were of low quality and tasted very processed. Overall experience was very poor and a complete waste of money.  Dr K S Sandhu,1,1,2,2,July 24 2024
Honestly for the money food diversity was average . I thought you would have something more for the money  you pay . but anyway it was a thing to do once in your life I’d say,3,3,5,3,July 24 2024
Variety of food  but less than last year. We go almost every year.,4,4,4,4,July 24 2024
Overall. excellent value for the variety of food items available,5,5,3,3,July 24 2024
Enjoyed dinner with family.  There were a variety of foods and desserts.,4,4,4,5,July 24 2024
Best buffet in Vegas. Crab legs were perfect. Lots of great choices.,5,5,5,4,July 24 2024
We are locals and try to eat here at least once a year. Expensive but the selection & quality of food is excellent. Not too happy they only allow 90 minutes for your meal. It takes so long to look around to see what you want. then stand in line to get it. my husband & I had some seafood then one plate of other food and our 90 minutes was already up!  I think it should be 2 hours as you’re walking around & waiting for about 30 minutes. Service at table was excellent,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
Everything was more wonderful than every other time I've gone. I just wish they'd extend the time to a full 2 hours to eat. so you're not rushing around through all of the people.,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
Excellent high end buffet. Each serving station had a variety of choices. Definitely a good idea to try a sampling of everything offered and go back for favorites if desired. I wasn’t overly impressed with the desert variety but that could be blamed on my over indulgence of the main course options.  Personally felt the value of the high end buffet was worth the cost. Most restaurants of that caliber and on the Boulevard are comparable in price. Recommend making reservations. We had an early dinner time in order to make a show and did not experience any wait time.,5,5,5,5,July 23 2024
Restaurante Buffett de lo más completo y delicioso en todos sus tipos de comida y postres.  Vale la pena el precio.,5,5,5,5,July 23 2024
Waiting in the line is annoying especially when you are hungry,4,5,3,3,July 23 2024
Had good experience at Bacchanal Buffet. If anyone wants to try. make sure to reserve a day before. Walk-in people waited more time than those people who reserved. The ambiance was good better than Bellagio buffet a d with more tables. The food was good. but the only complaint i have is the temperature of the food. Taste wise food was good. Another area for improvement is the dessert section. not at all tasty. less selection. and a few desserts was undercooked. Especially upside down pineapple cake. Overall. I rate this buffet 3 out of 5.,3,3,4,4,July 23 2024
A waitress named Karah was very rude. Ruined my pleasant dining experience.,2,3,1,2,July 23 2024
It wasn’t worth $86. Food lack flavor for sure. Dessert was just ok nothing to rave about. The videos I watch do it no justice. Should have went to the Wynn buffet smaller but way better flavor. Even the tables next to us were dissatisfied.,1,1,3,3,July 22 2024
Lots of options. ate small amounts of food but extremely full from everything. Desserts were amazing. Would go back again.,5,4,5,4,July 22 2024
Very good good taste,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
I have been wanting to go to this buffet since my husband told me about it 10 years ago. My daughters and I went on a mini Las Vegas girls get away and this was on my list to do. It did not disappoint! The food selections were outstanding. The lines were minimal. The service was exceptional. I will definitely go back the next time I am in Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Great customer service and the food was amazing! Will definitely eat there again when we visit Vegas again!,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Best $84.99 for a buffet. I’ll gladly purchase again,5,4,5,5,July 22 2024
Exquisito! Y abundante de alta calidad me gustó demasiado la carne,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Crab legs not fresh. one and a half hours are not enough.,4,4,3,4,July 22 2024
Great food and well worth the cost. Service was outstanding. Easy flow in and out. Would come back again.,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
#2 buffet in Las Vegas. Its was a good experience,4,4,4,4,July 22 2024
Overpriced the quality wasn’t what I paid for I wouldn’t go there ever very disappointing,1,1,1,1,July 22 2024
If you're not into seafood I would avoid this buffet as the cost of $85 per person would not be worth it. The food was pretty good though. Extremely busy and had a slight wait even with a reservation but had plenty of time to eat. Despite how busy they were they did an amazing job clearing plates. clearing and cleaning tables and getting people in. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and polite. Decent selection of various foods. Their desert selection is amazing. So many different desserts to choose from including a crepe station. gelato and creme brulee. It is a bit noisy because of how large of restaurant it is and how busy it is but where we were seated it was not to overwhelming.,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
Bacchanal Buffet definitely a must when visiting Las Vegas.  The quality of the food and variety makes it the best buffet we have ever had.  It's on the pricey side. but an experience well worth it!,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
I saw a lot of reviews. complaining about the food but I thought for a buffet it was exceptional.  Especially when you consider the masses of people they serve.  There was a bit of a wait checking in to get a table but again considering the number of people attending it wasn't too bad.  I thought the table service was excellent as well. There was one employee at the dessert bar that I feel deserves special recognition because of his friendliness and happy demeanor.  His name is Robb.  He was not only serving ice cream but also a big smile to go with it!,4,4,5,3,July 21 2024
I'm literally in Vegas quarterly. my first restaurant is Bacchanal every visit.  This visit was decent.  I typically enjoy everything.  The crab legs were cold and tasted weird. The macaroni cheese sauce was watery.    Really surprise that the food wasn't as expected.,4,3,5,4,July 21 2024
Had a 9:30pm reservation. You have 90 minutes which should give you till 11:00pm. By 10:30 they began to wrap up the dessert station Had to rush to get some dessert before everything was gone. We were finished before 11:00 and were just talking and we were asked by the manager that we had to leave because they were closing. I’ve eaten there at least 15 times over the years but have never had an experience such as this. The price has also gone up again.,3,4,4,3,July 21 2024
Definitely will be going again! Was one of the best buffets I've been to.,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
1st time at this restaurant. It was better than expected. The food was fresh. looked good. and tasted great. There was a variety of foods to choice from. The dessert bar was a perfect end to a  dinner. The sample sizes are the best.  Had a chance to taste several different desserts. The staff was very nice and attentive.  We come to Vegas once a year.  The Bacchanal Buffet will  become part of our annual Vegas/Birthday trip. I highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
"The food selection was diverse. and of good quality. but nothing truly ""wowed"" us.  Items like crab legs. shell on shrimp. and lobster claws were cold. which made them less desirable.  The dessert selection was very nice.  While not necessarily the restaurant's fault. the atmosphere was extremely noisy and overly congested with large groups of people.  It was not an environment that afforded a relaxing meal for us.   Parking in the Caesars Palace self-parking ramp was not a pleasant experience. and it was quite expensive due to a concert being scheduled for that Saturday night in the Forum.   We are glad that we got to experience the large and lavish presentation at Bacchanal Buffet. but we will not be returning. A high quality. quiet restaurant with an ala carte menu is probably where we will dine the next time.",2,3,4,3,July 21 2024
We waited about 10 minutes without a reservation on a Saturday. It was great and the food was delicious.,5,5,3,5,July 21 2024
Well line is not long and only wait for 10 min to go in,4,4,4,4,July 21 2024
I enjoyed the experience as I did previously. The time limit for the price needs to be considered. I will go there again because of the food options.,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
We had an amazing experience. From crab and frog legs to brisket and tacos everything was so delicious.  Desserts were awesome!! Best place in Vegas for all you can eat.  We came hungry and left satisfied and full,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
Food was amazing.  alot of options to really having you go back for more. The only down part is our server because she only came to use 2 times out of the whole time we were there and got to the point we had to ask the busboy to help us get more napkins and to let the server know for more refills. The place is really good though and I will be coming back again in the future,5,5,3,5,July 21 2024
Lots of food options. but they were all high quality. It’s pretty busy and totally worth it,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
It’s good when your hungry but only if server could keep up with the liquids cause watching her she did more walking towards the back and not coming out with any drinks and not once check on us if we need a refill if it’s that hard put a station for drinks since it’s all you can eat and drink buffet,4,4,2,3,July 21 2024
Not worth the 94 bucks per person. The only section of the buffet that was served hot was the Asian food. Everything else was room temp or cold. The service sucked. we had to keep looking for our server for refills and napkins. Then they push the tables so close together from the other parties that I felt I was part of there party. I would have rather gone to a good steak house. Ever since Covid. not the same at all. NEVER AGAIN!!!,2,2,1,1,July 20 2024
The food is tasty and plentiful at the Brunch Buffet. The price is $84.99. which is paid in advance. plus you pay the tip in advance. The price includes non-alcoholic drinks.  The brunch ends at a certain time. so if you are into breakfast foods. be sure to make your reservation early to enjoy your meal.  Overall. the food is excellent and service is great. Love the food and would go again despite the price.,4,4,4,4,July 20 2024
I regret to say that my recent experience was highly disappointing. Despite the promising reviews. they fell short of expectations. The quality did not justify the steep price tag. I encountered issues from the start. leading to frustration rather than satisfaction. Overall. it was not worth the time in line or the price.,2,2,4,2,July 20 2024
Always a treat to go there! Lots of choices Love them crab legs !,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
Always a great variety.  One of the best buffets in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
The 90-minute limit is a bummer. By the time we get our first plate. that’s already several minutes gone. Also. in the website it says bottomless mimosa on weekends. it was not. We bought our own Champagne bottle to enjoy mimosa.,3,3,3,4,July 20 2024
We are waiting almost 3hours. No table   No message. You don’t know how many people in front of you. When you ask the clerk. They always said. I don’t know. I don’t know.,1,1,1,1,July 20 2024
I paied $94 for only 40 min to eat and enjoy the resturant. after waiting since 6:30 PM,1,1,1,1,July 20 2024
Amazing delicious food!!! So many options and I highly recommend making reservations!! Can’t wait for our next girls trip. I’ll most definitely make reservations again,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
Muy bueno. alimentos de primera calidad. vale mucho la pena,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
Food was just average.  Was expecting a nicer environment- had a cafeteria vibe.  Great service though,3,3,5,2,July 20 2024
Everything was amazing!!!! I will definitely going back!,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
Large variety of foods.  All seafood dishes are cold. plain and bland.  Dishes were plentiful but lacked flavor.  Most dishes were not hot.  Servers and services were great. very friendly.   Checked off bucket list.,4,3,4,4,July 20 2024
Always an exceptional experience  with both food and service,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
Best Buffet!! I really enjoyed the brisket. Mac n cheese. queso birria tacos. and the Horchata!!! So awesome! Desserts were also so tasty and I like the small portions!,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
Bacchanal has been my go to Buffett every time I visit Las Vegas. i was surprised to be made aware of limited time there .although they didn’t harass my party it was unsettling. The quality and presentation of the food has never let me down until I got to the desert station . The cheesecake was lacking and they used dehydrated bananas in lieu of fresh ones. I did have some of the pecan pie which was pretty darn good. I’m guessing the reputation for being one of the buffets has gotten out because I definitely tell everyone I know about it .,4,5,5,3,July 19 2024
Great place to dine! Service and food were excellent!,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
The food was alright. With the amount of money that you spend here. The snow crabs were bland. brisket was good. prime rib was alright. Chinese food would be Chinese food. Just go to China town. Korean food. I’ll give it 1.5 stars. Dessert was ok. My recommendation if you plan on spending $75+ on lunch/dinner spend it on a nice restaurant that you will be spending on a dish that’s around $50-100. that way you will be getting quality food.,3,3,5,3,July 19 2024
Food is good however do not book a late table as all food starts to be removed at 10pm so when booking a table at 9:30pm you do not get a lot of time to explore all of the options,3,3,4,3,July 19 2024
Very good choices (beef in particular)  Nice table for 8   Amazing buffet  Just à little bit too long waiting at the buffet  Drinks not included and expensive  Otherwise. perfect,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
There was no advertisement about how much the buffet cost. There was no posting letting people know that they needed to make reservation. When I got to the front the cashier was very rude. And condescending after waiting for almost 2 hours for a seat. I had my elderly mother with me. It ruined the rest of our night the experience,1,1,1,1,July 19 2024
Unreasonable 1.5 hours only for the buffet. so rush. doesn't enjoy.,3,4,3,3,July 19 2024
Lots of food but not very good.......................,3,1,4,4,July 19 2024
This is our second dinner at bacchanal and again had a great time. Dim sum. poke tuna. prime rib. several kinds of crab legs. Boison mashed potatoes are the best. Excellent banana pudding. Our waiter kept an eye on us. even saw I needed a utensil for the crab before I asked. Love this place!,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
Food was very good. plenty of variety and great wait staff. Price was fair but experience was priceless.,5,4,5,3,July 18 2024
First time being in Las Vegas and really enjoyed the trip. Heard a lot about this restaurant and really enjoyed the experience. If I come back to Vegas. will definitely make sure I stop there again.,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Not worth the price for what we had to eat. Paid almost $90 per person,3,3,3,4,July 18 2024
Antes estaba mejor. han bajado la calidad de alimentos,3,3,4,4,July 18 2024
Nous avons trouvé le buffet trop chère pour ce que nous avons mangé.,2,2,4,2,July 18 2024
It was excellent and food was great. Our waiter was the best. He provided what we needed without any issues.,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Best buffet in las Vegas without question. The food is big on variety and quality. Everything we had there was excellent. I go there every time I’m in Vegas,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Food quality can be improved. priced too high for the quality of food provided.,4,3,4,5,July 18 2024
We have a reservation of 12. the table we sit at is not clean. The table is very sticky. lots of trash is still underneath the table. Server was very friendly.,3,3,3,3,July 18 2024
A bit of disappointment in food . It’s not what I expected,3,3,4,4,July 18 2024
Fantastic food and quick service,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Lobster claws were over cooked. Prime rib was good,3,3,3,3,July 18 2024
Enjoyed the selection of seafood. but was hoping for Hollandaise. Bur Blancs. or other sauces. Other than that it was great.,5,5,3,3,July 18 2024
Snow crab legs were small and not refilled enough. Lobster claws were good but taste nothing like the tails. Prime rib was excellent.,3,3,5,5,July 18 2024
The BEST buffet. So many delicious categories to  choose from.. including the deluxe seafood bar. sushi. smoked meat. made to order pasta. vegan options and many more. Save room for dessert as there is something for everyone and the portions are sized in a way that you can sample more than one. The service is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is lively. It is a great place to visit with something for everyone.,5,5,5,5,July 17 2024
At over 80 dollars you expect there to be a lot of options and there is. You also expect to leave there full and you do. But most importantly you expect to be blow away by the food which is where it fell short. My pallet may just not be for all the crazy food items they had being from Kentucky we like flavor and with the food choices they had it did not leave me wanting more. I tried a lot of stuff and unfortunately ended up wasting a lot because it just was not good. Ultimately I just settled for crab legs and made sure to eat 80 bucks worth. I’m not saying you aren’t going to like it but if you are looking to spend that much on a meal I’d look around a bit before settling on here,3,3,3,5,July 17 2024
The experience was ok. The food was average. not worth the money.,3,3,3,3,July 17 2024
Tres bon malgre le tarif Heureusement nous avons pris le service de 20h30 nous avions pu prendre le temps car le temps est limité On a 1h30 pour consommer le repas.,4,4,4,4,July 17 2024
Service was great - not only our server but the people at the buffet stations are so friendly and passionate.,5,5,5,5,July 17 2024
Service was excellent from check-in to getting seated.  We had a larger party and they were able to sit us next to each other.   Food was great for a buffet. really enjoyed the seafood section and sushi section.   The hamachi however was okay..the fish was dry and not sure if it was my piece only.  The nigiri was good. just wish there were more varieties of sushi.  My kids enjoyed the food.   The dessert was great as well.  Service was great. our table was always cleaned and drinks were refilled in a timely manner.,5,4,5,4,July 17 2024
Good food …lots of choices,4,4,5,3,July 16 2024
Great variety of food. We enjoy our meal. Service was amazing. Just an observation: We sat closer to the entrance. and we were able to listen to all discussions about tables and servers between the hostesses. That was a little annoying.,5,5,5,5,July 16 2024
Unfortunately. I did not care for the food. It was mostly cold and bland. Undeveined shrimp is totally unacceptable but was there. Server never explained anything so we stumbled across the dessert area when exiting. Terrible value for the money spent.,2,2,2,3,July 16 2024
Food was cold in most stations unfortunately......,2,1,3,4,July 16 2024
The food was very good. Our waitress was very sweet. The inside of Bacchanal is chic and upscale. However. the dessert station is a sad situation. I'm one of those people who like sweets better than actual food. There were no canolis or éclairs. No pies. tarts. or brownies. Just a bunch of small custard/mousse cups. a few different flavors of gelato. some cupcakes that were tasteless. and a bunch of chocolate chip cookies. which were totally ridiculous to even include at a buffet charging 85. per person. that did not include alcohol or gratuity. So that was pretty disappointing because the dessert station was what I was truly excited about. At that price point. the desserts should have been way more decadent.,4,4,4,4,July 16 2024
Excellent food too many great choice to make! The beef brisket was one of the best I’ve ever had! Not a big fan of the 90 minute rule that they stuck by.,5,5,4,4,July 16 2024
take a look at everything before starting. Enjoy everything by taking small plates,5,5,5,5,July 16 2024
The food was amazing. The price was steep but totally worth it. I can't wait to return!,5,5,5,5,July 16 2024
Too expensive. too loud. still have to line up with reservations. I might as well just show up without reservations.,5,5,5,2,July 16 2024
I was disappointed in the food quality and service.  There was nothing special about the food.  We were constantly waiting to get drinks served to the table. The display was pretty but that was about it.  It is not worth the $85.00.  This was my last buffet on a list of buffets to try in Vegas and this was not top 3 in my opinion,2,2,2,3,July 16 2024
Food and service was on point!! Definitely coming back again!,4,5,5,5,July 16 2024
They give you 90 minutes but that was more than enough time. High quality food.,5,5,5,5,July 16 2024
I did not even stay for the experience. When I made the reservation it stated on the website that the buffet was $50.99. When we arrived we were informed that the buffet was $92.00 per person. No where did it show that the buffet was that amount. I suggest that you display the correct amount that you are going to charge. Looked forward to the experience but not that price. Very dissatisfied customer.,1,1,1,1,July 15 2024
Very nice and needs to be done once. but right off the bat. waiter spilled water on our table and soaked my chair and napkins. Btw you only get 90 min eat and that mishap happens in the 1st 10 min so it slowed me down but in the end worth it.  The food is made to serve massive AMOUNTS of people so a good portion was under-seasoned . Overall 8 out 10.. largest buffet I have been to recommend doing once in your life.,5,4,2,5,July 15 2024
Bacchanal Buffet - Caesars Palace Las Vegas has a vast and wide variety of food. No one will leave without having something they enjoyed and liked.,3,4,4,4,July 15 2024
Food and price are not a match. If the diversity of seafood types could better meet the demands and expectations.,4,3,4,4,July 15 2024
I took a date there and it was their first time. They really enjoyed it.,5,5,5,5,July 15 2024
This is a MUST do while in Vegas!!! You won’t be disappointed!!,5,5,5,5,July 15 2024
Expensive with no oysters in a seafood buffet? Disappointed as a vegetarian that both the Mac and cheese and the refried beans had pork in the. What about the Hindu. Muslim and Jewish customers. Staff gave us no instructions as to how to pick food or order drinks. Tip prior to service was a waste. Will not be back.,1,1,3,3,July 15 2024
El mejor bufette de las vegas lo recomindo ampliamete,5,5,5,5,July 15 2024
Great selection of shellfish and meats.  All very good but non really exceptional but it is a buffet. an expensive one at that.  Glad We tried it once.  Left full but probably buffeted out!,4,4,4,5,July 15 2024
The enthusiastic service of the waiter does not affect the dining situation and maintains consistency in taking care of customers.,4,4,4,4,July 15 2024
Booked through open table showed up on time and got seated fairly quickly.  But still got charged 200 dollars for a no show on top of the 550 I paid to eat there,1,4,4,4,July 14 2024
Si no llevas reservación la cola es muy larga y con reservación es mas corta. la calidad de la comida es muy buena y muy variada. el lugar no es bonito. y solo te dan 90 minutos para comer y tienes que desocupar la mesa. el costo total con impuestos y propina es de 109 dlls por persona,4,5,3,3,July 14 2024
Food quality is not that great for the price. After tax is $91 per person is too expensive for this kind of quality.,2,1,3,2,July 14 2024
This is my third time dining here and it will be my last. First off the food selection was poor and the quality was subpar. The seat we were seated at was ripped up and uncomfortable. I had to sit on a napkin. This is unacceptable when you are paying $100 per person. It was just a disappointing experience. Go to the buffet at the Wynn. it is much better.,1,1,4,1,July 14 2024
We were satisfied with the food and the services. We will back because we didn't get to all of the different food stations.,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
The food was absolutely amazing!  It was a business meeting so I had an embarrassing moment when the server kept asking for my receipt.,5,5,3,5,July 14 2024
Nothing for vegetarian options. They need to start cooking vegg options,5,3,4,5,July 14 2024
There was so much to eat! Being Filipino. I loved that they had a lot of ube stuff and a section of Filipino food.,5,5,4,5,July 14 2024
The crawfish were out of season and the females had eggs.,2,1,5,5,July 14 2024
This is pricey but we'll worth it!  Beyond amazing!  Best buffet in Las Vegas. The selection is enormous & it's all great.,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
No one refilled our drinks throughout the entire meal. We called the waiter many times. but no one came to refill them. Eventually. they reordered a drink for us. but it was delivered and slammed onto the table. The dining experience was very poor.,1,3,1,3,July 14 2024
Great selection. value is good. a goto when in Vegas for a brunch,4,4,4,4,July 14 2024
This used to be my favorite buffet to hit in Vegas. Now not so much. The quality of food has gone down and I honestly was not impressed. While the servers refilled drinks promptly. when we were up to try something new our table was completely cleared...even the receipt. We had only been there around 30 minutes. When I got back to the table a server came over and I told her we clearly weren't done. she seemed annoyed but went and got new utensils etc. When I asked for my receipt (which they use to hold the table and track your time) she brought me a ripped up one that was someone else's from the trash. I will not be back. It seems this is just one more iconic place that has bit the dust,3,3,1,1,July 14 2024
It was just perfect! Everything was delicious definitely going back!,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
Everything was nice. Customer service was excellent the server he was an amazing only one thing the guy who was cutting with the pig head was he was not friendly at all. I asked him for a couple of pieces of ribs and pork. and he was very mean otherwise everything is beautiful.,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
After review all the positive YouTube videos and all the reviews of the Bacchanal buffet. we were very excited to come and experience the buffet. but it did not meet our expectations and nothing like what we saw from all the YouTuber and comments. I was very disappointed. The snow crab claw was chilled and cold. The lobster claw were partially frozen and cold. Very2 salty. My husband piece of steak was rare. dripping with blood and mine was burnt. It is not worth $84.99. The food was cheap and the Chinese food area was no difference than a Chinese buffet. The foods did not live to its’ big buffet name. I gave two star because of the many choices of desserts and the proactive staffs.,2,2,5,5,July 14 2024
Loved all the different options available so each person in our party was able to enjoy the cuisine(s) of their choice.  Great value for the cost as well.  Definitely worth a visit.  The crème brûlée gelato was fantastic.,4,4,4,4,July 14 2024
There were more entrees per station than most buffets. but it was still basic buffet fare: Asian. Mexican. Italian. salads. a carving station and dessert island. None of the food really stood out; I didn’t find myself wanting to go back for seconds on any of it. The overall layout and decor was nothing special or unique. Very standard buffet layout. And for $85 per person. I would have expected more. I’m glad I went to see for myself. but I don’t see myself going back.,3,3,5,3,July 14 2024
Amazing!!! Everything was delicious!  Thank you Bacchanal!,5,5,5,5,July 13 2024
Love coming to this buffet. Most of the food is great. Some misses here or there like some food being too dry but that's what happens sometimes at a buffet. The price is very expensive however so be prepared to spend $100 per person and I highly recommend making a reservation.,5,5,5,5,July 13 2024
Not a good value for the amount you pay especially since parking is not validated and it’s $35. We were looking Forward to the seafood part of the buffet. but All they had was snow. crab. legs. and sushi that didn’t look fresh. they were out of lobster claws and  octopus salad. The shrimp cocktail was too moist and had no flavor. We were visiting from San Diego and read reviews that this buffet was better Then the WYNN buffet and so that’s why we came,3,3,3,3,July 13 2024
I was impressed with the cleanliness and food options. Def worth the money and I will be back for sure!!!,5,5,4,4,July 13 2024
World level service and experience. every time I go back there it’s a life time lasting memory in the making for me.,5,5,5,5,July 13 2024
We had reservations for a Saturday at 10:30. With hearing it was so busy we thought we would have to wait but it was quick. You check in at the first desk with your reservation and proceed to pay at a kiosk with a card or go to the desk with cash. We had a card. so we used the kiosk. Kiosk defaults 30% and over tip. and we didn't want to pay that yet without knowing how it was (first time). I think that might have been an issue because I feel the staff that looked at the receipt. thinking we wouldn't tip. The food was really good. they had both breakfast and lunch at that time. All the staff were rude and the service was terrible. We asked for just coffee. and it took them 20 minutes. we just drank the waters they dropped off first. The second round of going out to get food. when we came back. they were cleaning our table getting ready for the next people. We told them we were still eating and they had to go get us fresh drinks. At that point. we were over it. We didn't leave our silverware on the plates. and our napkins were on the seats. I thought that indicated were still eating? Honestly. if I'm paying $80 a person for lunch I would expect better from the staff.,3,4,1,4,July 13 2024
Extremely overpriced.  Pancakes. French toast. breakfast meats were all cold; not even lukewarm; sitting under lights does not keep food warm! Food at Americana Cafe was much better and was served hot!,2,2,2,1,July 13 2024
I visited here for the first time while in Vegas. I was not expecting most of the seafood to be cold. That definitely threw me off.  The other entrees were decent. There was a bunch of dessert options although the portions were really small. They had some that were amazing. I spent almost $200 on 2 people. I was expecting more for sure. It’s not worth it to me. I’ve had better for cheaper.,3,3,3,3,July 13 2024
Some of the food was dry the brisket look like it had been burn￼up the crab legs that was supposed to be heated was not they were cold. The salad looked nasty. The bread was trifling hard like a rock. The desserts was the only thing that I thought was good but the meats look like I don't know if it's because we went in the afternoon after seven the meats was definitely not on point. It wasn't worth $95 or $92 and some change.￼,4,3,5,2,July 13 2024
Food was overcooked and at times inedible especially for the price we paid,3,3,5,3,July 13 2024
For the price there are many other options in Las Vegas. They advertise a Seafood Buffet with Lobster(only had claws). oysters(none). King Crab(none). Drinks are overpriced and service was not the best.had to wait 15 minutes for a Soft dink and water.,3,3,2,3,July 13 2024
Good food and a lot of variety. Make sure you come hungry,5,4,4,4,July 12 2024
Good food a bit pricey lovely ambiance Very good service,4,4,4,4,July 12 2024
Not great for gluten-free diners.    Get a chef to walk you around at this place to tell you what has gluten and what doesn't.  The labeling on the buffet is wildly inconsistent.    They have a gluten free menu but it doesn't match what's on the buffet.  Food is inconsistently labeled on the buffet with what allergens are in it.  For example. they use a wheat-based soy sauce so anything with soy is a no-go (but it just says Soy on the label. not wheat or gluten).  Again. you have to get a chef to give you a tour of the buffet to really know what's safe.  They will make stuff for you too if needed.  I appreciate that they're trying but they really need to update the labeling so people don't get sick.  Overall the food was good.  Not sure I'll go back because of price and the confusion with labeling.,3,4,5,3,July 12 2024
It was for my mothers 50th Birthday. I made the reservation the day before for 9:30 am. The buffet was amazing with so many options and the food was delicious. Hostess and waitress and the cooks answered any questions we had and they were very nice about it. In the dessert area they made my mom a very nice happy birthday dessert plate with a cupcake and a candle. Overall it was a very nice experience.,5,5,5,5,July 12 2024
Excellente experience comme d’habitude à chaque fois que nous y allons en groupe Nous avons adoré,5,5,5,5,July 12 2024
There is an amazing array of food. nearly all excellent—but the atmosphere is pure Golden Corral (or other low-end buffet). Expect to wait in line for a long time. even if you have a reservation. and expect lines inside de. Almost no one dresses up.,3,5,5,2,July 12 2024
I would never come back. All the food was cold. I didn’t even really eat dinner. It was expensive for no reason. The food wasn’t really good.,1,1,1,1,July 12 2024
We ate later because that was the time available.  All the seafood was watery and cold.  The prime rib was cold and overdone. Serve would only bring a refill drink and never saw her otherwise.  Last time we were there in November the food was good and the server brought butter and extra plate for shells and extra butter.,2,2,1,2,July 12 2024
First disclosure- not generally buffet lovers.  We came back to this buffet this year due to the tremendous food offerings. The food is above par considering the massive volume of customers (eaters). The food staff does a great job on keeping the food options available.  Table service was disjointed and lacked any method to this madness. Drinks were slow to be filled (and refilled). Plates piled up on the table and there seemed to be an overall disregard for cleaning them.  Every though we left indicators that we were still eating. as we went to get more selections our table was almost sat (caught them when we were  coming back) and another occurrence as they successfully sat another group. We came back from the dessert station and there were people eating at our table.  There is no active method used to prevent this from happening.  The decor. the serving areas and dining areas are past due for an upgrade.  The areas look dated and many things look abused. run down and pas the point of fixing.  Hopefully a full renovation will occur very soon.  I had high expectations for this $200 buffet; it simply has lost its luster and has lower to all other d Las Vegas buffets. Please fix this!,3,3,3,3,July 12 2024
A bit of a circus.  You make a reservation….when you get there you wait in line to check in.  Then in line to pay.  Then wait to get your table.  The staff are running around like crazy. so if you make a request for something(ie real butter for the crab). You get the typical BS.  Food was good.  Just a zoo/circus.,3,5,4,1,July 12 2024
I think it could've of been more of a food selection,4,3,4,5,July 11 2024
Check in staff were terrible. Very rude and appeared to have no customer service skills. Disappointing as every where else we have eaten in Vegas has been fantastic.,3,4,2,4,July 11 2024
We had a party of 5. We were all less than impressed with the quality of the food. The kiddos really enjoyed the gelato but for $85. I could have gotten it else where. All of our food was cold. No matter what station we went to. it was cold. The crab legs were ICE COLD. Even when they came out “fresh.” We travel to Vegas often and will not be back to eat here.,2,2,5,3,July 11 2024
The food was really good.  There were too many people.  It felt crowded.,4,5,4,3,July 11 2024
Excellent buffet with a ton of food choices! The drawback is that you only have 90 mins to eat. For the price you pay…you should get at least 2 hours to eat.,4,5,5,5,July 11 2024
The quick and simple process to check in and pay was seamless and very efficient. so there was no wait. The food choices were too many to name and everything was delicious. I loved the varied cuisines and the way the staff quickly served up the crab legs that everyone was eager to indulge in. I expected the line to be slow. but they moved everyone though quickly and kindly as he stacked them as high as each person asked. I can’t wait to visit Las Vegas and the Bacchanal Buffet again.,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
Fair at best. Seafood was poor shrimp mushy and over cooked. Beef was cold. Deserts were fair. The only reason I gave the food a 3 is the Asian portion was very good. Saw an article that rated it #1 for 2024 but I doubt they have actually eaten there. Table next to us had the same reaction. Way too much money for poor food.,3,3,2,2,July 11 2024
The sushi was dried out couldn’t eat it ! The mini burger was dried out and the bun was so dry it was hard! The deserts are not good . For the price of 85$ per person it definitely was NOT worth it at all. We was very disappointed! Won’t be back ……,2,2,5,4,July 11 2024
Although we had reservations. there was a long wait but the food and service were AMAZING!!!,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
Excellent selection. great service. fresh dishes and more importantly clean.,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
The food is verious. But the price is expensive. If the buffet is not in Caesar's palace. It is only worth $50 for one person.,3,4,3,3,July 11 2024
Not worth $85. No lobster tail. Sushi quality was very cheap quality. No sashimi. No abalone.,3,1,4,4,July 11 2024
Lovely food especially desert waiters very attentive glass never empty,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
One of the most impressive buffets I’ve been too. It fell short of the eye appeal and the price to quality ratio for me. While the selection of foods is stellar. many of the items were not terribly warm. overcooked or of mediocre quality. Not at all what one would expect for $85 per person. Very glad I was able to go. but not something I would repeat at the price.,3,3,5,5,July 11 2024
Great food. good for value. The seafood were decently fresh but i wish there is more of the fish dishes beside crabs and shrimps. The server were excellent! He was so eager and happy to serve us. constantly checking up on us.,5,5,5,5,July 10 2024
The lines were crazy long first thing when they open. The place was very busy. The food was delicious. The Mexican station was the standout for me. My girlfriend loved the crab legs and seafood boil station!,4,4,4,4,July 10 2024
Very upsetting I made a reservation for July 9th at 8:45 pm. Received a text with confirmation and when we arrived my reservation was no where to be found. We wore so upset that we walked away had no time to argue with staff. Remind you by 8pm we We’re starving. The last thing we wanted to do was wait any longer to eat. I feel that staff could have made the situation better by at least asking for proof instead they said reservation under that name is no nowhere to be find ! you could wait for cancellation. but it’s not guaranteed. I dinned here last year and had no problem what so ever but after this I wil never return,1,1,1,1,July 10 2024
I paid 243$ for 2 adults and 1 8yr old non alcoholic drinks included. From the lady checking us in to the waiter the service was great 5/5 stars. The buffet was busy but offered plenty of fresh options to choose. I would recommend anyone looking for an experience in Vegas to visit the bacchanal buffet.,5,5,4,5,July 10 2024
Food is of great quality and delicious.  Everything I tried (and my husband tried) was absolutely delicious.   We tried a little from every station. seafood. steak. Italian. etc. had a great variety which will certainly satisfy any palate Restaurant is clean and service is friendly.  Reservation in advance is highly necessary.,5,5,5,5,July 9 2024
Best place in Vegas. Great food quality available.,5,5,5,5,July 9 2024
Fun dining experience with abundance and variety of choices.,5,5,5,5,July 9 2024
Took to long to be seated.  The prime rib was dry . I ordered a rose to be set on the table it was not there . Took to long to get asked what we needed to drink. I didn’t know Golden Corel so expensive,2,2,1,1,July 9 2024
Our overall experience was a poor one .. very disorganized we had a reservation and had to stand in a long line.. it was so noisy and not clean at all.. the fish did not seem fresh it was not worth the money..,1,1,1,1,July 9 2024
It was great! The salmon and street corn were my favorite!,5,5,5,5,July 9 2024
Food options were awesome! The price is a bit steep  but that the general theme these days in Vegas. Some of the food was just lukewarm. Overall decent experience and would still go again.,4,4,4,4,July 9 2024
Good choices on food. one of the best buffets in Las Vegas Nevada,5,5,5,5,July 8 2024
It's very loud and impossible to enjoy everything in the 90 minutes. Lots of choices but the price has gotten to the point where I don't feel between the time limit and cost it is worth it. Everything is cooked beautifully but it's hard to push past the point of being full. which happens fairly quickly.,4,5,4,4,July 8 2024
not at Bacchanal. not worth the wait or the money. Thins is just a regular buffet and the seafood was poorly prepared.,1,2,2,2,July 8 2024
Even though it was kind of pricey for one meal. it was worth it.  I went for the experience.  I wanted to try a bunch of different foods.  The variety was fantastic. The presentation by the chefs was fantastic.  A delight for the sight. smell. and taste of food.  I will definitely go again.  I was in Las Vegas for a conference and the Bacchanal Buffet was my big treat to myself.  Go if you get a chance.  So what if you can't eat as much food as you pay for. go for the experience!,5,5,4,4,July 8 2024
Endless beautiful crab legs!! Great prime rib. Seats were very close together and it was like $100 per person. Great crab legs but that price is a little high for me.,4,5,4,3,July 8 2024
Over priced. They don’t tell you you only have 1.5 hours to eat until you get there and are seated. The food wasn’t great and it was noisy. People are running around you while you eat to rush to get more food. The best thing there was the lobster claws. I expected a lot more quality prepared foods .,2,2,2,2,July 8 2024
The food is outstanding. but not worth the price. Would appreciate separate tiers; one without seafood included being a bit cheaper.  Staff gave incorrect information at one point and made directions unclear. The folks handling the food were good. however.,3,4,2,2,July 8 2024
It’s ok not very fond of it others might like it but not us for the price of it not worth it,3,1,3,2,July 8 2024
Over all the food was not as good as it was in the past year when I first visited.,2,2,2,2,July 8 2024
The recent buffet visit proved disappointing. The food quality was subpar. with nothing particularly impressive on offer. For the high price. the experience fell short of expectations. The buffet seems highly overrated. offering little value for the cost.,3,2,4,3,July 8 2024
Price was too high for quality of the food. No raw oysters.,2,2,3,3,July 7 2024
Although the variety was decent it lacked some flavor .. ive been to many of the buffets in the area and wtnn gad a more open concept which made it easier to move around and see what was offered .. here it was a bit confusing and tight spaces made it difficult to get what you like.. for a 95$ a person i just expected more..,3,4,5,5,July 7 2024
The Bacchanal Buffet has to be the best Buffet I’ve ever seen. Every part of the Buffet from the beautiful lighting to the walls and setup truly sets this place from your average food buffet. There’s so many choices to choose from. and enough of variety to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. Love this Buffet!,5,5,5,5,July 7 2024
Great food & experience. Definitely worth the value!,5,5,5,5,July 7 2024
Service was excellent. The food was good. We love it.,4,4,5,5,July 7 2024
