Excellent food but Great Service! It lived up to expectations.,5,5,5,5,1 day ago
Great ‚ÄúOld Vegas‚Äù family-owned  restaurant. where many celebrities(The Rat Pack. John Wayne. Mario Andretti) frequented. The food is scrumptious. especially their steaks. and the staff is wonderful. You can tell they enjoy working there. It is pricey but a great choice for a special occasion.,5,5,5,5,1 day ago
Amazing 33rd birthday experience! Food was phenomenal!,5,5,5,5,1 day ago
Food was ok this time aroundbit have had better in the past. The cream spinach was on point as always but my steak was tough to cut and chew. We usually come here for the NFR every year. We had a party of 6. the service was not what it had been in the past. We ordered cheesecake to go and paid $12 dollars for the smallest piece of cheesecake I‚Äôve ever seen and highly recommend not getting the cheesecake. My wife and I got 2 bites a piece of a very small cheesecake.,3,3,3,3,2 days ago

Food was amazing and the Service was great. We love this place!,5,5,5,5,3 days ago
I eat here every time I go to Vegas.  It is a very hard reservation to get.  Food is always amazing. I have never had a bad meal.  We did feel our waiter this time was below the standards we have always seen there.  We felt rushed and when we wanted to pay the bill. we wanted to split it 3 ways between the couples.  I asked for him to put the bottle of wine on my ticket.  He said he could not do that.  Regardless. this is the first time I have ever had any issue.,5,5,3,5,3 days ago

Review for Golden Steer Steakhouse. Las Vegas  If you're considering a dining experience that combines exceptional food. top-notch service. and an inviting atmosphere. look no further than Golden Steer Steakhouse in Las Vegas. My visit was nothing short of extraordinary.  From the moment we arrived. the staff welcomed us with warmth and professionalism. setting the tone for a memorable evening. The service was impeccable; the team was attentive without being intrusive. ensuring that all our needs were met.  The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the steaks. which were cooked to absolute perfection‚Äîtender. juicy. and bursting with flavor. The lobster was equally impressive. expertly prepared and a true delight. One of the standout moments was the tableside Caesar salad‚Äîprepared fresh right in front of us. it was both entertaining and delicious.  Every side dish we ordered complemented our meal beautifully. adding to the overall fantastic dining experience. Each bite was a testament to the culinary expertise at Golden Steer.  If you're on the fence about dining here. I wholeheartedly encourage you to go. Whether it‚Äôs for a special occasion or just a night out. Golden Steer Steakhouse delivers an unforgettable experience that combines delicious food. exceptional service. and a warm atmosphere. You won't regret it!,5,5,5,5,6 days ago
Waited 3 months to get in and it did not disappoint. The service was amazing. I am so happy this restaurant lived up to the hype. We ordered the dinner for two long horn and lobster. The lobster was massive and the steak was perfect. I was purely more impressed of how attentive and on it the staff were. The best service I have had in a long time!,5,5,5,5,6 days ago
Old school steakhouse charm. Like traveling back in time.  Lobster tail is the biggest you'll find anywhere. Steaks are prime aged. Service is impeccable. staff very attentive. to the point that even wait staff not assigned as your server will check in you if they see you finished a drink. Caesar salad (fantastic) is prepared fresh (at your table if you order 2 or more) as are the bananas foster.,5,5,5,5,6 days ago
Steaks were amazing! The staff was exceptional and provided a great experience.,5,5,5,4,6 days ago
Awesome as always. great food and ambiance!!!! I would definitely recommend to others.,5,5,5,5,7 days ago
My wife and I came for our anniversary and they treated us very well. The history in the place is amazing too! Food is great!,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
A great experience and service top 3 in Las vegas.,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
I love golden steer! I love the history it has! You have to go here at least once if you‚Äôre visiting or you live here and you want to try it.. do it! This place is awesome! just for the history it‚Äôs  worth it!,5,4,5,5,December 4 2024
Great meal. My husband's prime rib was perfect. I ordered a steak and lobster. and the server didn't like the way the lobster looked or felt. so he brought me another one almost right away.,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
The entire experience was incredible.  Food was amazing.  It wasn‚Äôt tell we were leaving when we asked the Door Man how do we get a taxi!  He acted like we had a nerve to even ask!  He asked why would we ask him?  So started to walk down the street to find a taxi and luckily a taxi pulled up to us.  I had a 20 to tip the doorman but gave it to the taxi driver instead.  Taxi driver was happy when I gave him 40 for a 12 dollar taxi!,5,5,4,5,December 4 2024
I love the Golden Steer Steakhouse. The food is delicious and the service impeccable.,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
Our filets were grainy. crab legs tasted like they had gone bad and had a fishy smell and taste to them. For what they charge. it is not worth it. in my opinion.,2,1,4,5,December 4 2024
This restaurant is absolutely everything it is hyped up to be. Be prepared to be treated like Las Vegas royalty from the moment you step through the doors. The decor is total old school Las Vegas. totally like stepping back in time. The waitstaff is incredible and extremely knowledgeable.  Get the Tableside Caesar Salad for a unique and delicious experience. The steaks and lobster tails can't be beat. It's not cheap. that's for sure. but this is a great place for a special night out. The price is well worth the food. atmosphere. and whole experience. You won't be disappointed!,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
Definitely lived up to the hype. Everything was spectacular. from the moment we walked inside the restaurant.  Our servers were so attentive. we never wanted for anything.  Highly recommend the shrimp cocktail. First off. these are the largest rough I‚Äôve ever seen. Secondly. the spicy cocktail sauce is amazing!  We decided to do the tomahawk dinner for two. which came with two salads and two sides. We were happy to learn the tableside Caesar salad was an option. And everything was delicious and we particularly liked that. They timed everything perfectly so as we finished and they cleared things off it was time for our next course.  Definitely worth every penny. and we‚Äôre already trying to figure out when we‚Äôre going to come back. Ôøº,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
Great Experience!  Food was Amazing. Service was Top Notch. Would highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,December 4 2024
Everything it we hoped it would be. Incredible service from the time we entered till we left. Food was amazing and just a very pleasant and memorable dining experience. Highly recommended.,5,5,5,5,December 3 2024
This is the best steak we have ever had! We will be back every year!,5,5,5,5,December 3 2024
Such a great experience we had for dinner. Everything came out amazing. We got the dinner for two steak & lobster. Two sides we chose were the prime Mac and cheese with twice baked potato. The table side Cesar salad was presented with such class. All the waiters checking in was what we noticed the most. The attention to refilling drinks and taking plates away. The only downfall was that the heat was turned up a little to high they did have the air come on but wasn‚Äôt too much help. Other than that it was great!,5,5,5,5,December 3 2024
Everything was great! Best steak I‚Äôve probably ever had! Creamed spinach is to die for! Great waiters! Had a 7 year old and 11 month old and they were very accommodating and welcoming. 10/10 recommend you put coming here on your Vegas to do list!,5,5,5,5,December 3 2024
Fine dining in the spirit of the 60s. Service was impeccable. food was magnificent. If you want to be spoiled. this is it!,5,5,5,5,December 3 2024

Amazing place! It‚Äôs definitely my new favorite spot. very cool and lots of history.,5,5,5,5,December 1 2024
Such a great visit. I made notes on my reservations that it was my husband‚Äôs birthday. They went out of their way to help us celebrate him. All of the staff were amazing and so personable. making sure we were taken care of. The food was good but the experience was even more valuable.,5,5,5,5,December 1 2024
Great steak house. Great service. Stop by if you can.,5,5,5,5,December 1 2024

Food was great! Service was excellent. Gave me that old Vegas vibe I was looking for,5,5,5,5,November 29 2024
Foods was fabulous. Service wasn't great initially but without us saying a word the manager fixed the situation.  We had a large party of 9 and the second server was great. He was social and pleasant to interact with. He definitely helped turn our evening  around.,5,5,4,5,November 29 2024
Great experience arrived early and was told they were running behind but got seated right at our reservation time. Ordered drinks witch were strong .  Salad came out within 3 minutes of ordering and  food came out soon after salad was finished.  Food has fantastic steak was great and lobster was best I've ever had. Got a booth that was great.  Would highly recommend,5,5,5,5,November 29 2024
Start to finish one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Food was like no other. the service is above and beyond.,5,5,5,5,November 29 2024
Our dinner was amazing. From the cocktails to our steaks and side dishes. We can‚Äôt wait to go back. Service was great and the staff was very attentive. This is a must stop when in Vegas and when you can get a reservation. üíú,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
The part that intrigued me most about this location was the fact that you needed to make a reservation months in advance - that‚Äôs how I knew it had to be good. And it was more than just good. it was a perfect meal. Food was incredible. the location is gorgeous. it was so worth the wait. I can‚Äôt wait to come back!,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
Had the prime rib and lobster along with a bunch of apps. Loved the old school feeling and the 2 person booth we were in. Sat in John Wayne‚Äôs booth :) Great night. Great service. great food. definitely go back again and would recommend to everyone.,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
So delicious!  The table side Caesar salad was so good and the bananas foster was yummy.  Highly recommend the golden steer. thank you!,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
What wonderful experience. We have tried for years to get a reso here. it‚Äôs almost impossible!  So gladly we finally got one. This is an old time classic steak house. Food was amazing. The table side ceaser salad was to die for. So much fun. Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
An amazing night. Only took 2 years to finally get a reservation. but worth the wait. The Jumbo Western Australian Lobster Tail---- there are no words but OMG! I swear I was purring like a kitten. Cherries Jubilee was a joy from the gentleman creating it to the last drop. The 24oz Rib Eye Steak w/Bone-in was equally as amazing followed by Bananas Foster. On our  way out we made reservations for another great experience. Special call out to the door-man! He helped us park. I have a mobility scooter & lift on the back of my car making it long. With limited parking. drivers were going the wrong way and not watching out for others. The door-man stopped traffic for us and even put a cone behind our car once we were parked. THANK YOU!,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
Been wanting to come here for a couple of years. Was well worthy of the hype. Food and ambiance is top notch and looking forward to coming back very soon!,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
Golden Steer was an absolute highlight. My mom & I got the longhorn & lobster for 2 combo. which is the absolute best way to go IMO. We chose the table side Caesar salads. Neither my mom nor I are love Caesar salads typically. but this one blew us away. It‚Äôs the best we ever had. The steak was perfectly seasoned & the lobster tail was the most decadent amazing lobster I‚Äôve ever had. We got the whipped potatoes & the mushrooms as our sides. The longhorn with the potatoes & the mushrooms & their rich gravy was a luxurious experience. We also ordered the king crab legs. but they were watery & not as sweet as either my mom or I expected. BUT their customer service was top notch & they took care of us. We ended our meal with the table side bananas foster. Golden Steer was an experience I will treasure for a long time.,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
La atenci√≥n impecable.  Todo exquisito. los tragos. la comida y todos muy amables. Si vayan preparados para gastar unos 200 por persona,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
It was our first time and we loved it. The staff is nice. Crowded but not too crazy. The location is not very nice but food is good. Old school steakhouse. Parking is kinda bad. There are not wnough spaces. Anyways. for the food i love the ceasar salad. i love the calamari its perfect. Crab cake is very good. Steak is good and flavorfood. lobster is also good. Oh and their bread is so tasty with butter. Their banana foster is yummy!!! A bit strong flavor of the syrup but overall good!! We had a very good experience,5,5,5,4,November 28 2024
Had  an amazing meal here again. every single item we had was amazing and we tried a lot of different things! This isn‚Äôt our first time here but just as blown away by the food as the first time.,5,5,5,5,November 28 2024
We went for an Old Vegas feel celebrating our son‚Äôs 21st birthday and a friends 30th birthday we were NOT disappointed. The wine selection was great. The food was amazing and the service was impeccable.  The table side Caesar salad was probably the best I have ever had. Additionally the table side dessert presentation was fun fur the table. I would definitely recommend this experience for anyone wanted to feel like a celebrity in the 50s.,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
A truly spectacular experience. Everything. from top to bottom was delicious. and the service was fantastic. It was very loud. which made conversation and connection for our anniversary dinner a little awkward. but otherwise very nice. Highly recommend the prime rib and lamb chops!,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
This was our 5th time dining here.  It now. as my wife says. Permanently on our must go places when we visit Las Vegas.  Never change a thing!,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
Just as anticipated. old Vegas charm and ambience! Was fantastic in all aspects! Great Vegas Steakhouse!,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
The service and food was top-tier! Enjoyed the food and experience,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
We had a larger party and was hard to hear across the table. But no worries all was great,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
Great service & great food. I‚Äôll be back on next trip to Vegas.,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
Kind of felt rushed. Caesar salad could have been colder. Tomahawk steak was good. glad it was served with more seasoning I. The side to add. Cheesecake was served warm. I prefer chilled.,4,4,4,3,November 27 2024
This place is outstanding from the time you walk in. You are greeted with smiles and charm. The waitstaff is top notch. Asking questions and delivering an outstanding experience,5,5,5,5,November 27 2024
This placed iz hyped up way more than what the quality was. My wife hated it got sick won't be back unfortunately we wanted to love it,2,1,2,3,November 26 2024
I come here every time I visit Vegas. It is truly the highlight of the trip. Best steakhouse in the nation!! Would recommend to anyone and everyone.,5,5,5,5,November 26 2024
Fantastic restaurant with great food. service & atmosphere!,5,5,5,5,November 26 2024
Wonderful.  Historical.  The number 1 spot in Vegas. Thank you everyone at The Golden Steer.,5,5,5,5,November 26 2024
Our first experience was amazing! Steak was cooked perfectly and the Caesar salad was amazing! Thank you for the history lesson too!,5,5,5,5,November 26 2024
I‚Äôve been coming to Golden Steer for years. but this particular dinner. which we were celebrating my daughter‚Äôs birthday. was slightly below par.  Two things that greatly lacked quality were our baked potato and NY Strip steak.  The potato was so over cooked the skin was like leather and was basically inedible and the NY Strip was a bit too grisly and was actually hard to cut with a steak knife.  I order prime steaks from a purveyor in Chicago. and in comparison. it‚Äôs just hard to believe this was an actual prime cut of meat.  I‚Äôm sure had we said something both items would have been taken care of immediately. However. restaurants need to understand that as a customer. I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with sending food back and ruining the whole rhythm of the meal.  A good restaurant has the right chef and quality control to get it right the first time and not put any additional burden on the customer.  The appetizers and filets we ordered were all good. and the service was excellent.  I‚Äôm hoping that this was just a one time incident. but we‚Äôll be back in January and will provide a follow up review at that time.,3,3,4,4,November 25 2024
The service was amazing and the food was delicious! We'll be back again one day.,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
This was an amazing experience from start to finish.  James was our most excellent host!,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
We had a wonderful evening at Golden Steer Steakhouse celebrating a birthday! The only thing that frustrated us was that we were put in a very back small room next to the staff kitchen door. Also since the room was so small it was extremely loud. The food was fantastic and the service was also. Make sure to save room for the Bananas Foster.,5,5,5,3,November 24 2024
Such an amazing dinner experience! Service was incredible and the food was amazing. So excited we decided to go!,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
After 6 months waiting for the our dinner reservation date to arrive. Golden Steer did not disappoint. My  party of  7 came to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 21st bday . We were seated in our own private room of the restaurant which was a pleasant surprise. Our family indulged in the table side Caesar salad prepped by Alex to start. cocktails (With Love was our favorite - we ended up ordering 3 for the table!) garlic bread. Aussie lobster tails. bone in rib eye. salmon. NY strip. Shrimp de Jonghe (absolutely incredible w/good sized and tasty shrimp!) tomahawk . the mushrooms.  twice baked potatoes. cream of corn. and the bananas foster for dessert (also prepped table side) to top it off was so good! Service by Corey and James was so thoughtful and prompt. Not an empty glass in sight! Will definitely come back! Thank you for our awesome first dining experience! We look forward to dining there again and making that drive from LA for another special celebration. All the incredible reviews were spot on!,5,5,5,5,November 24 2024
The dining experience was beyond our expectations m. the staff were very helpful and knowledgeable in all regards to the Golden Steers‚Äô history and menu. We were greeted and treated like celebrities!  The food in a scale of 1-10 was above any rating.  One can feel the vibe and history of this excellent part of Las Vegas . We will dine there again.,5,5,5,5,November 22 2024
Love this place! I try to stop by anytime I‚Äôm in Vegas. The staff are knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the food is great as always. I enjoy the table side caesar and the banana foster experience.,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
Everything was amazing! My husband and I had been trying to get reservations for months and we finally did!!! We also had the opportunity to bring my parents and they LOVED IT!!! We all did!!! Thank you so much for the amazing service and food!,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
Amazing! Will definitely visit again! We found a last minute reservation!,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
I can understand why why this place is booked so far in advance. It was an amazing experience from the start. The service was next level. the food had great taste. even the cocktails had their own special thing to them as well. Even though it was a pricier steak house. my boyfriend and I would go again next year for sure.,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
The ambiance and service you receive is amazing!!! Everyone we interacted with was so nice and made sure we had everything we needed and our water glasses never went empty. We ordered the tomahawk. broccoli. and mashed potatoes and everything was exquisite! The steak was the best we have ever had and we would definitely recommend the Golden Steer!,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
We enjoyed the ‚Äúdinner for 2‚Äù. paired with fresh Cesar salad. mashed potatoes and asparagus. We ordered  tomahawk medium rare. it was prepared perfectly. Great service. Overall great experience.,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
The food was exceptional. and the beverages were flawless. The service provided was of the highest standard. We were unknowingly seated at the Muhammad Ali booth. which added a unique charm for us especially since we work in the boxing industry. Thank you to the team at Golden Steer; I eagerly anticipate my return.,5,5,5,5,November 21 2024
very good -   steak. lobster. caesar salad.  not good - potato was dry.   excellent service. good ambiance.   overall - expensive. but well worth going to at least once. really nice night out.,4,4,5,4,November 20 2024
Amazing experience! The food and service was fantastic. I highly recommend making a reservation well in advance. All steaks were cooked to perfection. It's a great space to experience. but it can be very loud and hard to hear the wait staff.,5,5,5,5,November 20 2024
We felt very rushed. After we ate our salad. our food was immediately served. The steak was cold. We didn‚Äôt feel seen when we dined here.,1,2,5,5,November 20 2024
Absolutely amazing. The food was phenomenal  and service was exceptional. Best steak on the planet,5,5,5,4,November 20 2024
It was our first time here for a 50th Bday celebration and it was Perfect. we even got to be in the Elvis Booth. it was perfect.  we will definitely be returning,5,5,5,5,November 20 2024
Incredible time! Ricardo was outstanding. We enjoyed our night so much.,5,5,5,5,November 20 2024

Excellent service. Food was delicious. Table side Cesar salad was perfect. longhorn steak was perfectly cooked and the lobster tail was the star of the meal.,5,5,5,5,November 19 2024
The Golden Steer our favorite restaurant once again did not disappoint. From the beverages to the appetizer to the tender. juicy. and flavorable steaks . Service from the team was spot on as well. The only if any blemish on our evening was that our direct server Umberto had little to no personality. He was more of a robot going through the motions. But it did not reflect from an otherwise great evening. We will look forward to returning soon.,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
My husbands Lobster was like rubber. Way over cook. For what we paid. should have been perfect. Rather disappointed,2,2,2,5,November 18 2024

As always amazing food. excellent service and an awesome experience.,5,5,5,5,November 18 2024
It was delicious. My old fashioned was perfect. And it cost more than our 3 night hotel stay at a resort hotel.,3,5,5,4,November 18 2024
Enjoyed the food and the ambiance! It's definitely a place to go to again!,5,5,4,4,November 17 2024

Food and service was second to none. Celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary and it could not have been better.,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
We got married in Vegas and wanted to have an intimate dinner the day after our wedding. Golden steer did not disappoint. The service and staff were excellent and the food was totally worth every penny. My husband enjoyed his prime rib. and the lobster. giant baked potatoes and mushrooms were delish. The bananas foster is a must try. 10/10 experience.,5,5,5,5,November 16 2024
Originally was planning to go to the 6666 pop up in the Wynn but had notifications for reservation cancellations setup in OpenTable and was able to snag a same evening reservation due to a cancellation. Was very happy and satisfied to go to this steakhouse instead.  The atmosphere of the restaurant takes you back to the early days of Vegas. Was imagining the Rat Pack and mob boss conversations that may have happened here. Just an incredible experience.  The steaks were some of the best that we have had. We had a petite filet and the prime rib. diamond cut. Both were amazing. The peppercorn sauce for the steak was perfect. We had the creamed corn and whipped potatoes and both were spot on. I did do the dinner salad and they also fixed that table side.  Very fun. We didn‚Äôt have room for dessert but watching the flambeau was a lot of fun for others.  I would say prices are in line with other top steak houses that I have had in the country.  Parking was a little difficult but we did find a spot in the lot next door.,5,5,5,5,November 14 2024
This was our second time here and was just as amazing as our first time!! Service was outstanding and the food was absolutely delicious! We did the dinner for two which consisted of steak and a lobster tail and two sides. Everything cooked to perfection and was so delicious!Ôøº,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
We made a reservation months ago in anticipation of our trip. We had a table for five of us that was set off to the side in a different dining room. We were a little disappointed in not being in the main room with all the pictures and memorabilia but the table was large. Our waiter David was so nice. His assistant Ali was super rude. He rolled his eyes every time someone asked a simple question and made the table uncomfortable. We ordered and the food was out pretty quick. The Caesar salad was delicious. The Angels chicken was really soggy and lacked flavor. The filets were excellent and cooked perfectly. The lobster tail was a huge disappointment. If you‚Äôre paying $105 for one lobster tail then the expectation would be a perfect cook on it. The tail was very overcooked and chewy. The mac and cheese was decent and the onion rolls were awesome. Overall it was a mid experience. I wouldn‚Äôt go back. I think my expectations were way too high based on how much hype surrounds it. Even the security guard outside was super rude. I guess I can say I tried it,2,2,2,2,November 13 2024
Ali and his group took care of us like kings!!!! Can not thank him the kid‚Äôs assisting him and of course the Golden steer enough for another exceptional experience Dr. Devine,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
Great steaks! Staff very attentive. Would definitely be a repeat customer!,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
Worth the wait to dine here. I‚Äôve always heard about the Golden Steer and passed by and so glad I‚Äôm able to say I‚Äôve eaten there. Service given by David and Ali were great. All of our food was hot & all tasted delicious. Davi‚Äôs took the time to give us a little history on the restaurant and highlighted different rooms. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and look forward to taking family back,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
Good and service were 5 stars.  Would definitely go again.,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
This is a very positive review. We ate there last night. The service was wonderful. The crab cake and French onion soup starters were excellent. The filets were cooked perfectly. Unfortunately. our Lobster Tails were overcooked. The waiter immediately came over and offered a replacement. The manager came over apologized and offered us dessert. Overall everything was great! The service was definitely outstanding.,5,4,5,5,November 13 2024
Amazing. Everything was amazing. The service. the quality of the food. the portion sizes. An amazing experience.,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
Friendly staffs. fast service and the meals was delicious,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
We had a great time and the experience was great. Love it.,5,5,5,5,November 13 2024
This was a wonderful experience. The staff was incredibly attentive and welcoming.  Service and food were outstanding!! Will definitely come back !,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
The old school service is refreshing to see. I loved it. The food was great. We did get a cold side but they replaced it AND removed it from my bill so they did everything possible and without me having to do much b,5,4,5,5,November 12 2024
By the far the best dining experience you will ever have. Extremely friendly. accommodating staff. The food is too notch. But the best part? The rich history of the establishment that every staff member is extremely knowledgeable of. The atmosphere makes you feel like you can strike up a conversation with the next table. This is why we come all the way from Michigan and will continue to visit whenever we can.,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
Truly one of our favorite places! I dream about the tableside caesar salad. Ambiance can't be beat.  This is the only restaurant we will come to on every singe trip of ours to Vegas.,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
Absolutely fantastic! From the food to the service. everything was a 10/10. Their timing and the atmosphere were just perfect.,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
Four of us had a fabulous dinner last night at the Golden Steer. We could not have asked for a more perfect experience. We were able to sit in the Dean Martin booth and had a fabulous team wait on us. Two people had filets. one had the Sea Bass and one the lobster. We shared two loaded baked potatoes. and a salad with their homemade Roquefort dressing. We topped the meal off with the bananas foster. The waiters made it a memorable evening with stories and a presentation of food that was delicious and beautiful. We will definitely be back!!!,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
It was every bit worth the wait of getting the booking 6 months out,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
Best lobster tails ever! Try the snail appetizer is delicious!!!,5,5,5,5,November 12 2024
This probably won't be a very popular review. I had never been to the Golden Steer but wanted to see what the fuss was all about. It's a Las Vegas landmark. frequented for over 50 years by some of the most notable celebrities and dignitaries. I was impressed with the overall look and feel of the place and I did like the curved booths....just like you used to see in the movies back in the day. I do have to say. it was a bit noisy. but it was still a very nice place. The service was impeccable - never experiences any better anywhere. The food was excellent across the board. I am retired and living comfortably. so I can afford a high-end restaurant...BUT....seriously? $200 for an 8-oz filet and lobster tail?? The shrimp cocktail was $28. but it was the biggest shrimp on the planet - so I can't complain about that price. I have been to some expensive restaurants. but this one takes the cake. Our tab for 3 people. which included just TWO entrees - one of which was shared - and drinks was $536. With a 20% tip. the total was $676. The ambience and history of the restaurant was not enough for me to justify the price of the food. I would have enjoyed the Eiffel Tower much more and it would have been about half the price we paid. I really think this was just another example of the emperor's new clothes. Everyone goes to the Golden Steer and acts like they are having the time of their life when it's really no different than any other steak house. I am not up-in-arms over it - I chose to go there knowing it was expensive. but we probably won't be back...and ONLY  because of the menu prices.,4,4,5,4,November 11 2024
The overall experience was great. You can tell they really pride themselves on service. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure to check up on us very often. The food portions were surprisingly big for a steakhouse. We ordered the calamari and king crab cocktail to start both were tasty and the calamari was decently sized. After appetizers we each ordered salads. The wedge salad was huge. it came with tomato‚Äôs and bacon and was definitely worth it for the price. however I think the Cesar salad was a bit overpriced. The flavor was good but nothing special for the price. For entrees we ordered a petite filet & a 24oz ribeye both came out cooked to perfection and the flavor was definitely there with the meat. The sides we ordered were creamy spinach and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was good. nothing special but good enough to be steakhouse quality. The spinach on the other hand was very creamy almost too creamy. It was hard to eat with a fork because it was so slippery and finely cut you could barely pick it up. After dinner we got a complimentary cheesecake with chocolate drizzle as we were celebrating our anniversary. The cheesecake was good. simple but flavorful. Lastly. the ambience here was nice. Each booth you sit in is personalized to a past celebrity who sat there and they had a QR code on the wall so you can read about the celebrity who‚Äôs booth you are sitting in incase you didn‚Äôt already know their back story. The one downfall I will say is the waiting area/lobby. it tends to get very overcrowded very quickly and can be quite chaotic with waiters moving in and out to get to the private dining rooms and the bar. Overall though it was a great experience and I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others wanting a nice steakhouse experience.,5,4,5,5,November 11 2024
One of the greatest meals I've ever eaten highly recommend it straight up 10 out of 10,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
An excellent special occasion experience! Highly recommended! Ôøº,5,5,5,5,November 11 2024
Absolutely fantastic. will return on future trips.,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
Excellent.   First time and it was great.  And delish.  So much history.,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
We had to ask our waiter to remove a bug that was crawling on the table. He brought over a napkin to grab it. we had it trapped under a plate while we waited for it to be removed. The waiter apologized but we didn‚Äôt see a manager at all. The food was good. not outstanding,3,3,3,3,November 10 2024
Fabulous- words don‚Äôt do it justice- a phenomenal experience!!!,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
BYRON and Erik were great and we just absolutely adore  Venmo . He is the best.,5,5,5,5,November 10 2024
This place never disappoints. My go to for out of town guests.,5,5,5,5,November 9 2024
It was our 17th anniversary and we got to say hello to the chef. The meal was amazing. everything was fresh and delicious for the rolls to the slice of celebratory cheesecake we were complimented. It was really fun watching the ceasar salad being made. There was RatPack music playing and the staff was so nice. Best Midori sour I ever had.. Cheer to the staff for making this a wonderful and memorable night.,5,5,5,5,November 9 2024
Service was exceptional  Food was brought out in a timely manner drinks were constantly being refilled. Wait staff was friendly and attentive   Will return again,5,5,5,5,November 9 2024
Absolutely.positively the best steak I've ever had.  The lobster was phenomenal.  The entire meal and experience was everything I hoped for.  Entire party had a great time.    Wish I could give more stars.,5,5,5,5,November 9 2024
For our anniversary. we treated ourselves at The Golden Steer Steakhouse and it was a phenomenal experience.   The service was exceptional. making us feel celebrated and attended to. The food was delicious. the table side Caesar salad was fantastic. the Filets were outstanding and cooked to perfection. Every bite melted in our mouths. Our sides were equally delicious. twice baked potato. prime macaroni and cheese and sweet creamed corn. We ended our dining experience with table side cherry jubilee. it was to die for!   The Golden Steer made our anniversary dinner unforgettable. It‚Äôs a must visit for anyone in search of a memorable dining experience in Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,November 8 2024
Food was AMAZING! The BEST steak dinner I have had in LV with exceptional customer service. Table side Cesar Salad is a must when dining here. Sat in the Marilyn Monroe booth that gave an old school vibe. Reservation was the last time slot available and did not feel rushed. Opt for the Bananas Foster dessert and it did not disappoint.  Will definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,November 7 2024
it was a really exciting evening! see you surely againüëå,5,5,5,5,November 7 2024
They only do one bill. They won‚Äôt separate parties at the table   It wasn‚Äôt an issue in the end and not a deal breaker. Just a heads up would have been nice. They said it‚Äôs because one person use to pick up the whole check.  lol not in 2024 our total was over $500.  Our friend had oysters and they were very tiny! He was not impressed,5,5,5,3,November 7 2024
Top notch service! Food was excellent. Can‚Äôt wait to plan our next trip back!,5,5,5,5,November 7 2024
Well worth the difficulty getting a reservation. I tried to get a reservation over a month in advance but with no luck. So I made alerts for an opening. I got several notifications but again disappointed to click the button and find it was gone to someone else. Finally only days before our trip I did succeed  and it was worth it. The service .food.and atmosphere were excellent. Our reservation was at 9:30 so one of the lasts of the day. Our food took a little longer to come out and we were offered free dessert. We were pretty full after dinner so they gave us dessert to go. I ordered a 12 oz prime rib and got the 18 oz which they gave to me at the 12 price so lucky me had lunch the next day.  We will definitely go back(if we can get a reservation)!!!,5,5,5,5,November 6 2024
Absolutely awesome experience. Service was on point. Food was excellent. The restaurant had a great party fun atmosphere. Will definitely come back. Delicious!,5,5,5,5,November 6 2024
To begin the service was impeccable! Every staff member that came by our table was attentive and they took a team approach to providing the best possible service. Our group of  four tried several different appetizers. meals. desserts. and cocktails each of which were amazing! Our server was great at answering all the questions we had and guiding us through our meal. He made excellent suggestions for both food and cocktail variations that really helped make our experience exceptional! Thank you so much for raising the bar and  allowing us to experience such a great dining atmosphere.ÔøºÔøº,5,5,5,5,November 6 2024
Salad for two. Crab. Ribeye steak. & Lobster. a Wonderful Birthday thanks to JUSTIN. our wine connoisseur and the GREATEST PERSON at The Golden Steer!!,5,5,5,5,November 5 2024
Visitors from uk. Having been to Vegas before we knew about the Golden Steer. This time I was organised enough to book a table 3 months in advance so guarantee we got a table for this visit. Totally worth it. having tried other ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù steak houses on the strip. this place really is real deal. Great atmosphere. delicious food and takes you back in time with all the history. The steak though is what you go for and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Totally yummy xx,5,5,5,5,November 4 2024
Would go back a million time.,5,5,5,5,November 4 2024

Lovely 20th Anniversary dinner. The staff was entertaining and fabulous! The food wonderful. The lobster tail was the best we‚Äôve had. Thank you to The Golden Steer for a memorable experience!,5,5,5,5,November 3 2024
This is a gem in Las Vegas. Hard to get a reservation but well worth it. Portions are large and by far the best steak you will ever have.  Customer service was top notch. Highly recommend,5,5,5,5,November 2 2024
Great experience. Super friendly staff.  Presentation was excellent. Had my first tomahawk steak it was huge but kinda on the warm side. But the taste was great. Don‚Äôt forget to go beyond the booth and learn some interesting facts about your favorite artist from back in the day,3,3,5,3,November 2 2024
Solid steak house.  Service was solid and servers were super nice. Food was OK‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs tough when I‚Äôm used to house of prime rib.  Tried their prime rib and house of prime rib is heads and tails better.  Cool atmosphere too.,3,3,3,3,November 2 2024
Outstanding restaurant. Will be back when we return to Vegas,5,5,5,5,November 2 2024
Old style ambiance! Excellent food. Second time dining there both visits were awesome. Can‚Äôt beat the steaks!,5,5,5,5,November 1 2024

Iconic restaurant with great service and ambiance.  We will be back!,5,5,5,5,October 30 2024
Tableside caesar salad was one of the best  ever. Teamwork based servers is a very pleasant experience. Loved the lobster and longhorn. Original furnishings and decor tops off the whole visit.  We will return.,5,5,5,5,October 30 2024
Our first time there. The food was good. But we waited 40mins for our 2nd course.  Server doesn't explain anything so we had no idea pricing and everything  Overall it‚Äôs ok.!,4,4,3,3,October 30 2024
I was there for my birthday and wanted to visit one of the best steak houses in Vegas. I love prime rib so I know what to expect when I order a good steak. I ordered a diamond cut prime rib and was disappointed. My steak was cold. flavorless and so hard to cut. I ordered my steak medium rare and it was completely dry. I asked for a side of Au jus and never received it. Twice baked potato was salty. Sweet corn was good. My kids loved the complimentary dinner rolls.,2,2,2,4,October 30 2024
Top premiere dining experience. Only gripe would be the parking situation. Reserve months in advance. this is well worth every penny.,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
Had a great time at food was excellent definitely would go back!! Ôøº,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
The service and food are great. A bit too loud but I was able to ignore it.,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
"The service was amazing. We got to sit at Dean Martin's booth. The food...Best Tomahawk steak and lobster. soft and flavorful. The Caesar salad and Banana Fosters is a MUST. As my brother in law stated. ""this is dinner and a show. what an experience."" We definitely will be back!",5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
We had the best time at Golden Steer Steakhouse. The food and service are outstanding. Not even mentioned the ambiance. One of a kind place . The best  New York strip in Las Vegas . We celebrated our anniversary and had an amazing experience. Would be back for sure even though it‚Äôs hard to find a table . I made  a reservation 4 months in advance.,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
Always the best. Service and food is top notch. Had the porterhouse and it was amazing.,5,5,5,5,October 29 2024
The food was delicious. The service was impeccable.,5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
Everything our group ordered was beyond amazing. We had everything from the filet to the New York strip. the legendary Caesar salad. meatballs. broccoli. and prime Mac n cheese. Everything was amazing! This is a must eat!,5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
We had to wait a little for our 6pm reservation but it was busy. The service was impeccable. Atmosphere was great. Food was good. We had a nice experience.,4,4,5,5,October 28 2024
I have eaten at many fine dining steakhouses in my time but I can honestly say that the GS is by far the best. Service. food. ambiance was all top notch.,5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
Our dinner exceeded all of my expectations. The service is top notch. table side service incredible. Liquor. wine & food to die for. but the dessert..heaven,5,5,5,5,October 28 2024
The wait to get a reservation was extremely long.  I‚Äôve been in Vegas three years and this was the first time I could get a reservation.  The service was great and the food was absolutely delicious.  The table side Caesar salad was the best I‚Äôve ever had and my son‚Äôs lobster tail. while very pricey. was delicious and the biggest I‚Äôve ever seen. The ambiance was quiet and relaxing. I would say the only negative was I felt a little bit shamed by the waiter when I ordered salmon. I have a heart condition so I don‚Äôt eat red meat but this restaurant was my son‚Äôs choice for his 40th birthday and I was excited to share it with him.  It didn‚Äôt feel great for him to give me a hard time about ordering fish in a steak restaurant. The other staff were very friendly and attentive so I appreciated them very much.  My son absolutely enjoyed his birthday celebration.,5,5,5,5,October 27 2024
Lobster tail was overcooked and hard. steak was amazing. herb butter was just melted butter. hostess was not very friendly. never thanked us for coming as we passed by her after spending a lot of money. Waiters were knowledgeable and attentive. First and last time.,3,3,3,3,October 27 2024
Awesomeness!!! Must have steak experience in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,October 27 2024
The service was amazing. We had to wait 30 mins after our reservations as we were sent a comp app that was amazing. We came to Vegas for my birthday to go to this restaurant. I ordered the steak and crab legs and was very disappointed. The steak was cooked to perfection but the crab legs was 3 split in half crab legs.  So it was only 1 full crab leg and a small half. Nothing like what was shown on social media to get me to book a flight and pay for a hotel. Def would have gotten the lobster tail instead.,3,3,5,3,October 27 2024
Exceptional food and service. Everything we expected and more!,5,5,5,5,October 27 2024
The restaurant is overrated. food is basic. While the steak was good. the calamari felt like rubber. Some dishes were presented nicely. but overall. the flavors were nothing special. On a positive note. the cocktails were excellent. However. the ambience could have been improved if they enforced their dress code. as allowing guests in shorts diminished the atmosphere. I don‚Äôt understand the hype.,3,3,5,2,October 26 2024
This is a great place for a special dinner. Anniversary or Birthday. The place has the best service. From the hostess to the waiters it was awesome. Pricey so come prepared steak and lobster is $225.00 but it's was delicious. Make reservations way in advance to get in. Lots of history in this building. Enjoy we did.,5,5,5,4,October 26 2024
One of the best steaks we ever had. My son had 24 oz Longhorn strip‚Äîhuge but fabulous.,5,5,5,5,October 26 2024
Absolutely a great experience and the best food! 10 for 10 wine and banana Foster pairing. Is a must!  Very glad we booked that resi 6+ months in advance ! We loved it!,5,5,5,5,October 25 2024
Our server was great. The food was amazing lobster was perfection. I will be back every time I come to Las Vegas,5,5,5,5,October 25 2024

Legendary Las Vegas Restaurant‚Ä¶. Great food. service and ambiance,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
Went for anniversary dinner with 2 other couples. We were seated on time in private dining area where other large parties were. Server came up and asked for drink order as soon as we sat down without a chance to look at cocktail menu. Took a few orders then rushed away. Returned with 3 drinks and then the other 3 ordered drinks. Asked if we were ready to order before got drinks. Ordered dinners and before we could order wine he rushed away. Finally ordered wine. When he came with the wine. one of the glasses of wine was wrong. so he took it back and brought back correct wine. Incorrect wine ended up on the billl in addition to others.Received Caesar salads. then dinners. Caesar salads were fine.My husband and I split a 24 oz ribeye which said we would split. Brought steak and put it down in front of me and gave my husband just an empty plate. Did not offer to split it. Steak was okay but nothing to rave about. Asked for medium. Received a med well. Steak had lots of fat and wasn‚Äôt real tender. Also had their ‚ÄúVegas largest baked potatoe‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt large and was dry without a lot of flavor. Dinner for 6 with only 3 entrees plus a couple appetizers. 3 salads. 5 cocktails. and wine with 18% tip and tax was $900. We had been here once before a few years back and it was much better. Don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll be back. Disappointing.,3,3,2,1,October 24 2024
Our whole experience was amazing. The waiter Ali was on top of things and the food was outstanding! We had the petite filet and the Australian lobster tail. We got in by chance and were so thankful. We will definitely be visiting again!,5,5,5,5,October 24 2024
We were sat about 840. it did get kind of loud however I would do it again in a minute!  Best steak ever!,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
The food quality. service and ambience were great. but I think the experience was over priced.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. so it was a splurge that we agreed to. but ‚ÄúThe Socials‚Äù have overhyped this steak house.  Glad to have had the pleasure. but I‚Äôll likely source my own XL lobster tails in the future.,4,5,5,5,October 23 2024
The Golden Steer is an old school classic! The Caesar salad prepared table side was the best I have ever eaten and the service was excellent! I would highly recommend the Golden Steer for any occasion.,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
Everything was outstanding with exceptional personal service,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
Amazing - always a stop when in Vegas!  Was wonderful to treat the family to a fabulous meal.,5,5,5,5,October 23 2024
This is a must visit every time my husband and I are in Vegas.  We have never had a bad meal and the service is a 10/10 each time.  If you're on the fence about ordering the Caesar Salad. ORDER IT!  You won't regret it.,5,5,5,4,October 22 2024
Outstanding service vibe on point decor Amazing made our wedding Evening extra Special Spencer and team outstanding!!!,5,4,5,5,October 22 2024

We had the best cocktails. great service and fabulous food!! We will be back!!,5,5,5,5,October 21 2024
I had tried for MONTHS to get a reservation and one opened up on my last day in town. could not have been happier! Everything from the service to the food was outstanding. The booth I wanted was unavailable but it didn‚Äôt stop them from allowing me to take some photos. even offered to take them for me which was so kind. Our server Justen was wonderful. helped us make informed decisions on portion sizes (which we really appreciated!) I can see why it‚Äôs been around as long as it has. will definitely be back if I have the opportunity.,5,5,5,5,October 20 2024
This is an iconic old Vegas steak house. Loved the history and ambience. Its quite pricey and thats okay but when you pay 70.00 for a petite filet. you expect it to be darn near perfect. Ours were not. I just dont think the quality of their beef is great. Kind of tough in texture and hard to cut and chew. Ive had a lot of great steaks and these just didn‚Äôt compare. Both of ours were not that tender. Sorry. but give me ruth christ or allen brothers. That being said. the table side caesar salad was perfection and to die for! The twice baked potato was quite good also. Service was just mediocre. not great. All in all we liked it but oh it could be SO MUCH BETTER! But if you love the old Las Vegas history. its really pretty cool. Special shout out to the Sommelier who was very engaging and attentive and regaled us with many tales of the restaurant‚Äôs history.,4,3,3,5,October 20 2024
The entire dining experience was excellent. The service was top-notch and the food was delicious! I would highly recommend The Golden Steer!,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
This was the best experience I‚Äôve ever had at a restaurant. Everyone was so accommodating and kind and the food was next level. I don‚Äôt even like steak that much but I knew I had to visit Golden Steer at least once and have steak and it was the best steak I‚Äôve ever had. I will dream about that meal and now Golden Steer is a staple for my Vegas trips. 10/10! üòç,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
If you get the opportunity to score a reservation. definitely go. The food is amazing and the service is next to none. The best dining experience I‚Äôve ever had.,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
It was great everything was good. from the time we walked in everyone was super friendly and the waiters didn‚Äôt for me to ask for anything they were on it,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Steeped in Vegas history. Golden Steer did not disappoint. Service was excellent. cocktails were just right. and the surf and turf combo is a must. Will be making reservations now for our next trip.,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Excellent service . teamwork throughout the  meal course.,5,4,5,4,October 19 2024
This restaurant is INSANE!  Just a FABULOUS. delightful restaurant in every way!,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
The Golden Steer never disappoints! Food quality is top notch. It doesn‚Äôt get much better than this. We try to get reservations here every time we come to Vegas; it‚Äôs the culinary highlight of our trip. Love. love. love this place!!!,5,5,5,5,October 19 2024
Incredible meal and service. We had a large group and the attention was superb.  Get the Cesar salad prepared tableside,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
Extremely sad it did not live up to the hype.  Our service was terrible and our food was subpar. The drinks were ok. couldn't believe we paid $80 for 2 beverages...insane! Super bummed. we were really excited to dine here and it let us down.,2,2,1,3,October 18 2024
Amazing. a must do experience for all locals and those visiting Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
Amazing experience. staff. food & atmosphere. Our party were visiting from Australia & the UK and everyone can't stop talking about our night. Can't wait to return.,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
Golden Steer has the best service. food is phenomenal. We ordered a tomahawk steak and it was perfect. The place is not that fancy but the service is topnotch.,5,5,5,4,October 18 2024
Excellent service. Steaks were cooked perfectly. We will visit again when in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 18 2024
Great atmosphere with great food. prime rib is worth the trip alone,5,5,5,5,October 17 2024
It was AMAZING!!! Service was outstanding and food was fantastic!!!,5,5,5,5,October 17 2024
Our steaks were cooked perfectly to our order. Table side service for Caesar salad and Bananas Foster was a work of art. Our server. James and Jed the salad maker were professionals who know how to treat customers right. We were called sir. and Madame. which is much better than being called ‚Äúguys ‚Äú. Make your reservation now because they are always booked.,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
One of the best steaks we have ever had! There‚Äôs a reason this place has reservations out about 6 months‚Ä¶..,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Nice. anniversary dinner spot! We celebrated 11 yrs here with a wonderful mean & service.,5,5,5,4,October 16 2024
"Firstly I was put off by having a reservation for 915pm and arriving at the venue at to having to drive back home because my kid. the birthday boy. was wearing a brand new Nike leisure suit. There were patrons in denim shorts. t-shirts. and sneakers but this was absolutely fine. When I inquired about how this was acceptable and his was not. they stated ""dress shorts"" were ok. Definitely have not seen a pair of dress shorts but ok fine. I inquired why was not this stated before or when I made my reservation and they said they texted me the information the day prior. Which I had not seen and with my phone in hand. showed them and they couldn't not provide me with a number which the text may have originated from. So we go change and get back and we are seated right away. From that point on the service was absolutely amazing. Every one was cordial and our order was taken right away. My son had the Filet and lobster and I had the chicken parmesan. Food was excellent. service was excellent and they did a presentation for my son with a flaming ice and banana dish and a slice of cheesecake with a candle and that portion was on the house. So in all the food and the service is excellent. Just be aware. being in Vegas and dressing for the heat may not allow you to sit. Even a sun visor for women or a baseball cap for men is a no go for an off strip restaurant in a not so great strip mall area.",4,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Great experience and awesome food!tecomment to anyone in LV,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Staff was AMAZING!  Food was delicious. The restaurant was awesome and beautiful.,5,5,5,5,October 16 2024
Excelente comida la carne y las patas de cangrejo espectaculares,5,5,5,4,October 15 2024
First time here with a friend that has talked it up for years. It‚Äôs up there with my favorite steakhouses in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 15 2024
I have been here a couple times and each time is just as good as the first,5,5,5,5,October 15 2024
Service was outstanding!  Friendly and attentive. not intrusive.  We heard about specifics on the menu.   Our appetizers were delicious‚Ä¶the shrimp were huge.  I had the short horn steak‚Ä¶wonderful.  Husband had the filet.  He was very happy.  Side dishes were amazing.  I thought this place would be overhyped‚Ä¶it was not!  We will be back as we love the old Vegas feel.  More importantly. we felt the waitstaff wanted us there!,5,5,5,5,October 15 2024
We had to make a reservation 3 months in advance & I was happy to do that because I had a lot of good memories in this place.  What a disappointment!  Grit in our potato. & tough filet mignon were just a couple issues. Our waiter started out great. and then disappeared after the appetizers.  We waited over twenty minutes for anyone to notice our food hadn't been served. This was a very disappointing experience that has soured my taste for Golden Steer for once & all.,3,2,1,2,October 14 2024
Great place to dine if you‚Äôre looking for that old Vegas feel!!,5,5,5,5,October 14 2024
I was so excited to finally get to eat here. but I didn‚Äôt have the best experience. My sister‚Äôs food was perfect. We both had the 16 oz New York strip. She had hers with herbed butter and I ordered mine Oscar style. We both had the Caesar. which was good but a bit heavy on the dressing. She loved the mushrooms side dish and both of our steaks were cooked perfectly. The issue for me was that the crab on my steak tasted very overcooked and had that ‚Äúfishy‚Äù taste when seafood is a little old or just not fresh enough. The flavor was unpleasant. When I got to that part of the steak. which was after two or three bites. I stopped eating it and it took a long while to flag down our servers. as they were also serving a large party that came in. We had to ask other servers to send them over for us. When they finally arrived at our table for me to tell them. they offered another steak. I accepted but asked for herbed butter. not Oscar style. It took a very long time for the new steak to arrive. It was cooked perfectly as well. but after waiting so long. we were just ready to go. I ate a few bites then packed up the rest. If you go. maybe avoid the crab. and hopefully your experience will be better than mine.,3,2,2,4,October 14 2024
Absolutely amazing! Everything was phenomenal. I don‚Äôt know if I can have a Caesar salad any other way than freshly made. Ôøº,5,5,5,5,October 14 2024
Worth it! Service was superb! Food was delicious!  Best Caesar salad and prime rib I have ever had.   We don‚Äôt save room for dessert.   Worth the wait and money!,5,5,5,5,October 14 2024
It was a cool restaurant inside. That‚Äôs what my friend - whose birthday we were celebrating - came for‚Ä¶mission accomplished!,4,3,3,5,October 13 2024
The food was delicious. The service was impeccable!  They dote on your every need. A fun evening with old Vegas charm.,5,5,5,5,October 13 2024
First time great experience and worth it - food and service was phenomenal and I‚Äôd highly recommend the place especially for a date. Old school vibes and prices Not astronomical,5,5,5,5,October 13 2024
Everything from being seated at our table to paying the bill went without a hitch. The atmosphere and attention to detail was amazing. the food was incredible (the servings were way more than we could eat). and the best customer service by ALL staff. It was our first time and we were treated like we were regulars. A great experience.,5,5,5,5,October 12 2024
Golden Steer is a classic steakhouse that delivers an exceptional dining experience. From when you step in. the ambiance exudes warmth and nostalgia. reminiscent of old-school Vegas charm. Food is good. the classic steakhouse offerings. The lobster is to die for. hefty weight. succulent meat! Overall a good dining experience.,5,4,4,5,October 12 2024
As always. the entire experience was phenomenal! The service was perfect.,5,5,5,5,October 12 2024
The wedge salad was delicious. the ribeye was amazing and the lobster tail was one of the best I have had in years! The service was great and their willingness to help made the experience great.Ôøº we finished off the night with bananas Foster made table side and couldn‚Äôt have been better .Ôøº,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
Well worth the wait. We booked 5 months in advance to make certain we had a table for when we were in Vegas. Recommend you do the same.   The steak was incredible. Perfectly cooked.   Service was quick and efficient. All the servers were friendly. polite and chatty.   Couldn‚Äôt fault it at all.,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
We actually just went for my birthday on October 10 and it was amazing and such a great time. The food is tremendous. Thank you for such a wonderful wonderful evening.,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
Excellent service. ambiance and food. A very ‚ÄúOld Vegas‚Äù restaurant with service reminiscent of the past. Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
Having last minute access to a Vegas gem was just the start to a lovely meal and dining experience all around. Every detail was considered by the ever doting staff. The ambiance was timeless and cozy. The fare was perfectly prepared and presented. We highly recommend indulging in the Caesar for 2. followed by a couple slabs of premium cuts of golden steer paired with the macaroni and cheese. and asparagus. Will return. will recommend. will remember until the end of time. Will document in my steak album to be shared near and far.,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
Great food with old charm decor and ambiance. Service was excellent as well as the food!,5,5,5,5,October 11 2024
The best old school Las Vegas restaurant hands down. No matter how popular and busy it gets. the service and ambiance is top notch. the main room transports you back to another era. And the food. drinks. and wine list never fail to satisfy...and empty your wallet. Well worth it though. Here's to another 66 years.,5,5,5,5,October 10 2024
Besides the food and drinks being amazing. I think the service was beyond exceptional! A must eat at and well worth it.,5,5,5,5,October 10 2024
This was our first time at the Golden Steer and it did not disappoint! We ate so much that night. we didn't eat breakfast the next day. Food and service  is impeccable! What a great experience!,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
Excellent dinner. We got table side cesar. shared a tomahawk steak and finished with table side banana fosters. Our waiter was great and was an excellent experience thank you!,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
It was our first time visiting Golden Steer ! The food was Delicious. The servers were all friendly and helpful . drinks delicious . If you‚Äôre looking for a truly unforgettable dining experience Golden Steer is a must visit .,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
The atmosphere and staff were unmatched. We arrived earlier than we planned and ended up being seated 15 minutes early. The place was packed and all the staff attending to us were still on top of everything keeping drinks filled and checking if our food was delicious. The tableside Caesar salad was an amazing experience and the best Caesar salad I‚Äôve ever had! The steaks were cooked to perfection. the lobster tail was absolutely delicious. The tableside bananas foster was also delicious and an AMAZING presentation. the staff also threw in a piece of cheesecake with a candle as we were there celebrating our anniversary. 20/10 highly recommend. Can‚Äôt wait until we can come back!,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
Place ran like a well oiled machine. Dinner was superb and I‚Äôd go back in a second!,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
This was the best dinner I think we have ever had. The hospitality was amazing and the food was much better then anything we could have expected. The whole vibe of the restaurant was so cool and old school Vegas. I would recommend this place to anyone.,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
10 out of 10. Not one thing we would change! So good!,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
We loved our meal and the service! We plan to come back next year. The Caesar salad that was prepared at our table was delicious. We highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,October 9 2024
For my husband's 50th birthday. I took him to Las Vegas. NV. travelled from Boston. MA. We heard so many good things about the Golden Steer. as it was highly recommended. I had to make reservations for this establishment six months prior to the trip. The Golden Steer has history. and understandably so but our dining experience was not great. For the price we paid for the food. it was not worth it. Now for the review of the actual meal. The steak was overcooked. which meant it was not tender and a little dry; therefore. no flavor. The amount of money we paid for the Australian lobster tail wasn't worth it as it was not that big (we've had bigger lobster tails in Boston) and it was undercooked. The Chilean Sea Bass was just okay (again. Boston is better). The roasted vegetables were hard. which meant they were undercooked. I could see if our reservation was towards the evening and they were 'rushing' but I made the reservation for when they open their doors. which was 4:30 pm. The thin slice of cheesecake was underwhelming. Our meal should have been impeccable but sadly. it did not live up to the hype. The saving grace to the entire meal were the result of two things: (1) The Caesar Salad was made in front of us. and it was delicious. (2) the staff was very attentive. They constantly checked on us. Their tip was well deserved. I will not visit this establishment again.,3,3,5,3,October 7 2024
Ordered the longhorn and lobster dinner for two with the Caesar salad. Both were overcooked. The soup and sides were fine but was definitely underwhelming.  The highlight was the cherries jubilee.,2,2,3,3,October 7 2024
Absolutely. great.  There is a reason you guys are the GOLD standard of steakhouses in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
Great old school steakhouse  Table side Caesar Salad is a must,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
Great meal. Great service. A fun experience. Great spot,4,4,5,5,October 7 2024
Outstanding wine selection. exceptional caesar salad and speciality waiter making it tableside was outstanding. legendary. historical spot.  Flavorful and tender steak.  I would recommend and scheduled to return. The hostess. bar staff and food support staff were excellent  With THAT SAID. our waiter was condescending from the start. failed to mention the portion sizes and when our food arrived late. worried but seemed only about his tip.   We had a $500 meal. it arrived late and was so much food. it was overkill.  When the waiter offered free dessert. it was a little too late and after not eating half of the meal. seemed a mute point.  Consider myself a foodie. will go back it be smarter about portions.  Another disappointing tidbit. they were doing tours during our meal- this didn‚Äôt bother me as much as it did my husband.  It did bother me someone was videotaping me eating my meal‚Ä¶  Food for thought‚Ä¶. order the caesar. enjoy the carneros chardonnay and the filet.  Don‚Äôt be afraid to share if needed.  I sincerely hope the food service staff gets some of the tips!,4,4,2,3,October 7 2024
Chef‚Äôs kiss perfection - food.service. atmosphere!! A fantastic experience!,5,5,5,5,October 7 2024
A unique experience. Ambiance. service. and food all deserve a 5 star rating.,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
Great ambience. Drinks were amazing. Food was good. not amazing. Overall we had a great time.,4,4,5,5,October 6 2024
Great food and service. Our host along with all the staff were very good at making sure we had everything we wanted.,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
After waiting 6 months from our reservation date. we were super excited to finally go to Golden Steer! Overall it was a nice experience. Service was good. Table side Cesar was exceptional!!  Food came out cold. Cocktails were very good. I think its a bucket list place. once and done. Super. super expensive. We regularly go to top notch steak restaurants and can honestly say some better ones.,4,3,4,3,October 6 2024
Great experience. we sat in the Elvis booth. prime rib and ribeye were amazing. Also got the bananas foster for dessert.,5,5,5,5,October 6 2024
It was an astounding experience. The service was impeccable and the ambiance was amazing.,5,5,5,5,October 5 2024
Everything was amazing!! The service was top notch and the food just melted in your mouth. Will be back again,5,5,5,5,October 5 2024
Awesome experience. everything we order was tasty.  Ceaser salad golden steer style was on point.  Steak and lobster tail was so delicious.  Try the bananas foster for dessert.  Great service. staff was  friendly and have a smile on their face.  Definitely will be back.,5,5,5,5,October 5 2024
We had a great meal and the service was top notch!,5,5,5,5,October 5 2024
We had a great experience from the beginning of our visit. I had recommended to sit at our favorite booth. Because we come to Vegas once or twice a year I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of the booth so I described it in my request. The hostess knew exactly what booth I was requesting. She walked us to our booth called the ‚ÄúBetty  Grable‚Äù booth. There were so many staff members involved in our dinner experience I couldn‚Äôt remember all their names. From the water poured . to the bread rolls set on the table to the wine delivered to the amazing lobster & steak presented. Loved hearing the Rat Pack music in the background. This restaurant makes you feel like you are back to the 1960‚Äôs. Loved how groomed and handsome all the waiters looked. Loved their uniforms too. They looked the part of the 60‚Äôs. Thank you to Corey our main waiter for great excellent service! A big thanks goes out to all the Chefs in the back for cooking the food. Back at home in the Bay we rave about your restaurant. Golden Steer we will see you soon again.,5,5,5,5,October 5 2024
Overall it is definitely an experience to be had.  The staff is amazing and the table side Caesar salad was worth the hype and Chris our salad guy made the experience memorable with aa little history of the restaurant!  Just keep in mind. you are paying for the food as well as the overall moment!! A must do for sure!!!,5,5,5,5,October 5 2024
Had to try this iconic place and have heard so much about it.  Positives:  atmosphere. the CEASER SALAD. service.  Unfortunately steaks (petit filet‚Äôs) were only average and underseasoned. and my king crab was a little fishy tasting.  For the price. honestly I expected spectacular.  It was a fun experience but there are plenty of other steakhouses to try so likely won‚Äôt return. Fairly disappointed.,3,3,5,5,October 4 2024
Amazing experience for my husband on his 65th birthday! It was our first time to Vegas and the Golden Steer was highly recommended by my friend. We will absolutely be back if we can get in. lol!,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
Absolutely the Best Steak and Lobster you will ever have!,5,5,5,5,October 4 2024
Great salad they make it at the table. Shrimp appetizer was awesome. Cocktails were awesome. Was fun. The waiter was very attentive. The only thing they said they enforce a dress code and people were underdressed. Also there was a line to get in. They should have a separate line for people with reservations!,5,5,5,4,October 3 2024
We absolutely LOVED our experience at Golden Steer. I would highly recommend. Come hungry! It was a ton of food! The atmosphere is very cool and a throw back to the golden days of Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
Amazing experience. amazing staff. amazing food. Will always plan a trip to the Steer when I am in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
From the old Vegas. history. to the classic Vegas atmosphere. through the service and the food. our experience was superb in every way.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
This was my 2nd visit and just like the first time. the service was impeccable and the food was exceptional. It‚Äôs just fantastic all the way around. I was cold when I first sat down and ordered a hot toddy. so the server asked if I wanted a wrap/shawl. And brought a perfectly folded wrap. And the hot toddy was perfect! Between the 2 of us. we had the french onion soup. table-side caesar (which is a must have!).  creamed spinach. giant baked potato (I‚Äôve never seen a potato that big in my life and the bananas foster. We shared the ribeye. It was my friend‚Äôs first time and she said it was the best steak she ever had. Everything was fantastic and we didn‚Äôt feel rushed. though they were very busy.,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT!!!.  Our new go to resturant,5,5,5,5,October 3 2024
As always another fantastic dinner from the Golden Steer . the tableside Ceasar is delicious with the dressing prepared from fresh ingredients right before your eyes. The bone marrow is a new edition to the menu and it is perfectly complimented with a salsa Verde.  Now the real surprise was chicken of the Angels  ..my wife got this and the chicken was so tender it melted in your mouth. My prime rib was flavorful and tender and the side of broccoli was cooked to perfection as well ( I hate soggy limp vegetables),5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
Exp√©rience extraordinaire. Nourriture plus qu‚Äôexcellente. Ambiance agr√©able. Service impeccable.,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
By far the best steakhouse I have ever been to anywhere!!! Not only was the food perfection. but the service was extraordinary.  This place exceeded the hype!!,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
Golden Steer is a must visit for us when going to Vegas. Portions are big and definitely sharable. Make reservations ahead as they are BUSY.,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
Absolutely amazing! It was like a thrill ride with food included. This was truly the experience of a lifetime. We thank you all.,5,5,5,5,October 2 2024
Old school Vegas vibe with awesome food and service.,5,5,5,5,October 1 2024
From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel welcomed. Cocktails were fantastic and our table staff. lead by Justin. knocked it out of the park. We over ordered sides. our fault. but only suggestion would be to offer a couple smaller steak options. The ribeye was outstanding. but only comes in 24oz. so ended up leaving some. Would we go back yes. but now know how to order. Thanks again for a great evening,5,5,5,5,October 1 2024
From the second we walked up security greeted us and le us know we were in for a great experience. Had reservations for 730 and were taken to our table by a very friendly lady! Our servers were very polite and and helpful with telling us about the appetizers and our main course. We got the table side Caesar salad and the gentleman told us the history of who sat at what booths and the rest of the restaurants history. The Caesar salad was amazing we got our food and it was cooked to perfection. It was our anniversary and they gave us a piece of cheesecake and wished us a happy anniversary. We always decided to do the full experience and ordered dessert we got the cherry jubilee and it was an amazing experience watching them make it at the table and it was delicious!! Overall experience was above and beyond will definitely be returning!!,5,5,5,5,October 1 2024
Amazing!!!!! We got the surf crab lags and lobster. So good. Cesar salad was amazing also.,5,5,5,5,October 1 2024
Over advertised and the appeal is gone.  Lobster had no taste and over cooked.   Served a dirty martinj glass with Lipstick on it. Kids crying . people dressed in warm up suits not following supposed dress code i received a text about. will never return.  We used to love the place.  It‚Äôs sad.,1,1,3,3,October 1 2024
A fantastic experience. ambience was great. staff could not have been better. steak was amazing.  You are crazy not to go here if you are in Vegas.   You won‚Äôt be disappointed.,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
Fly down just for dinner at Golden Steer. So iconic and the feeling to be dining at the same place that past celebrities did was life changing.  Service was excellent and the quality and taste of everything was equally great.  My wife and I will definitely be back,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
A classic steakhouse experience with great service and quality of the food.,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
Such an amazing experience! So much history. Would definitely recommend and go back.,5,4,5,5,September 30 2024
Shrimp cocktail was mushy. but my steak and twice baked were great along with bananas foster. Service was not great. Took quite a long time to get a drink. Overall. I would say this is the worst visit I have had here.,3,4,2,5,September 30 2024
We have been eagerly waiting for months to get in and it was well worth the wait! Fantastic drinks. service. and food! We will definitely be back! We had the prime rib and lobster. the ceaser salad. asparagus. and mashed potatoes. Sooooooo good!,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
Definitely was a great experience. Lots of choices for food. drinks and desserts. Ôøº,5,5,4,5,September 30 2024
From start to finish everything was amazing. Even our picky steak eaters were blown away and our non-seafood eater was grabbing more shrimp & pieces of lobster tail. We went for my husband‚Äôs 50th and will always try to come back when in Vegas soooo worth it and servers were amazing!!!,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
Amazing service and amazing food! Had filets with lobster. along with the table-side Caesar salad. and the bananas foster for dessert. Highly recommend all those! Definitely a great place to treat yourself or for a special occasion!,5,5,5,5,September 30 2024
Excellent time at Golden Steer with my wife and family. Everyone really enjoyed the food. service and ambiance. Ricardo and his team were very attentive and Jed make an amazing Caesar salad. The filet Mignon was like butter and the crab legs were massive. We will be back next time in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Was really looking forward to experiencing a true historic steakhouse...This place is exactly that. However. the service did not match the hype.  Server was rushed and pushed us along to order and eat.  The table next to us received the full attention with backstories of famous guests and history.  Worth a $450 dinner cost. I don't think so especially with so many other steak options in Vegas.  Would recommend grabbing a drink at the bar and taking in the sights and smells but go elsewhere for the service you deserve and would expect.,3,3,2,4,September 29 2024
Amazing experience. food was excellent. will definitely go back,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Food and service were outstanding!   Our food was cooked and served to perfection. The bananas fosters was delicious,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
After living in Las Vegas for close to 30 years. we finally got around to dining at Golden Steer for our wedding anniversary.  Reservations book out months in advance so I checked daily until I could reserve a table.  The reservation system was easy and efficient.    The parking lot in front of Golden Steer fills up super fast because it is so small so we parked at a nearby location and walked. it took less than 5 minutes.  We checked in about 10 minutes early so waited in the lobby/bar area and to say the place was hopping would be an understatement!  The ambiance was energetic. and it ramped up our excitement for dinner.  Our server team was amazing!  We are so terrible at names; I believe it was Diego and Jared?  I apologize if I've got that wrong.  They were very attentive and answered all of our questions and gave us suggestions.  Super nice guys!  The food was so delicious!  We both ordered the 8oz petite filet which was cooked a perfect medium rare.  The creamed spinach was so tasty. and the baked potato was huge!  And the garlic bread!  Oh. my goodness. so addicting!    I had indicated when I made the reservation that it was for our anniversary. and everyone from the hostess to the servers all congratulated us and wished us a happy anniversary. and after dinner even brought us a slice of cheesecake with a candle to celebrate.    Golden Steer lived up to all the hype we've heard about it over the years.  With such excellent service and the highest quality food. the price tag obviously reflects that. so as much as we'd love to visit often. it will be a location reserved for the most special of occasions.  It is totally worth it though. even if we only visit it this one time.  Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
I am in my 60's and have had more steaks from chop houses than I can count. Hands down the best I have ever had!  I have only had a couple of people I know that have been here and they have highly recommended it. So I decided I needed to give it a try.  I had to make reservations almost 6 months in advance to get a time suited for my wife and I and a couple of friends but as recommended. it was well worth the wait! So much so. I have already made reservations for our next visit.  Now the evening went. both my wife and the wife of my friend who joined us eat pretty light so splitting dinners was the way we went. We had the porterhouse and they the bone-in ribeye. 2 sides each. he and I both had dinner salads and they shared a French onion soup. Even though we each split steaks with our wives. it turned to still be a lot of food. I took quite a bit of steak back to the hotel for a snack the next day.  The meat was of quality I have never experienced at any restaurant or home for that matter. the filet was almost buttery and beyond tender. similar to A5 consistency. The strip side was almost the same but a bit more structure. Outstanding! The 4 sides at the table were very large and we should have only ordered 2 for the table.  Dessert course was passed on because it was our anniversary and we were given a slice of cheesecake that we all shared.  10+ stars!! See you in March!!!,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Amazing as always!! Never disappoints! Can‚Äôt wait to go back in February! Food and service are top notch!,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Spectacular service and the best steak I've had since moving to Las Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 29 2024
Justin was an awesome server Food was awesome Worth the visit,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Best meal we have ever had! We would eat here everyday if we could. Appreciate our server explaining the type of lobster tail and texture they have. We went with steaks and crab legs and the Caesar salad and it was AMAZING. We didn't even bother with our sides. We got the broccoli which seemed not cooked through all the way and the twice baked which was just okay but we didn't even care as the steaks and crab legs were so good and we didn't have enough room.,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Wonderful experience! Best steak off the beaten path. Excellent customer service!,4,4,5,5,September 28 2024
The entire staff was wonderful. Treated us like VIP. friendly funny and courteous. Ordered table side Caesar salad best ever. Rib eye was huge my boyfriend said cooked perfectly. Lobster tail was huge cooked perfectly as well. Crab legs were delish,5,5,5,5,September 28 2024
Outstanding food and spectacular service. Loved this experience!,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
The food is amazing! I‚Äôm not a steak eater but my husband is. and he said it was delicious! I had the sea bass and it was so flavorful and moist. Would definitely eat here again!,4,4,4,4,September 27 2024
Easily one of the best steaks I have ever eaten in my life. A bit pricey for some folks but well worth the money to dine at this caliber of food.,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
Tableside Caesar salad for the win. Pick any steak. it will be great,5,5,5,5,September 27 2024
Pricy and loud but delicious. We met a nice couple in the bar who were hoping a spot would open for them at the bar as they didn‚Äôt have reservations and management let us change our reservation from 2 to 4 people so they could join us at our reserved table.  It was a really fun night. Turned out they were staying at the same hotel so we also shared an Uber home.  Would definitely go again!,5,5,5,4,September 26 2024
A great old nostalgic steakhouse that I love. Great Caesar made table side. steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. and finished it off with cherries jubilee cooked table side. The wait staff and service was impeccable. Couldn‚Äôt have wished for  anything better.,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
We had such a great first time experience. Will definitely be back in the future!,5,5,5,5,September 26 2024
My wife and I first time here and made reservations for 25th anniversary. My wife and I ordered ribeyes. both came out already cut and were very hard to chew due to a lot of fatty marbling. We also both added a lobster tail which was a little over cooked. Servers were great wish the food was better. I‚Äôve had better steak at Ruth‚Äôs Chris.,2,2,5,5,September 25 2024
I'll make it short. The service was excellent. the food was good and the cost was ridiculously overpriced. Nothing special food wise to warrant much higher prices.,4,4,5,4,September 25 2024
The steak was amazing. the lobster was exceptional. and the atmosphere was top notch! You must visit this gem!,5,5,5,5,September 25 2024
Service and food was great. way over priced for sure.,5,5,5,5,September 25 2024
The quality steak  it was okay.   Is not the one u expected.    Everything else is good.   Is this kind a Price with the steak . they should have more better.   My steak  over cook  also.     OVERALL  the ambience . the service  is good,3,2,4,4,September 25 2024
Had dinner with friends and had a phenomenal experience. James and his co-workers went above and beyond and made the experience sp great.  The food and service was fantastic. Definitely will be back.,5,5,5,5,September 25 2024
My husband and I dined last night at sat at the Marilyn Monroe booth! Everyone was so friendly and informative! I love the history so much. someone took us around to see the booths and explained who sat where. The food was amazing. I‚Äôm a huge fan! My husbands birthday is this weekend. I wanted to take him somewhere special. They gave him a slice of cheesecake. it was so good and creamy!! When we come back to Vegas next year I‚Äôd love to sit in the Elvis booth!! Thank you everyone at Golden Steer for making this an amazing experience!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5,5,5,5,September 25 2024
Felt very out of place. Staff was very stuffy. Probably won‚Äôt go back but can say one been there!,3,4,4,3,September 25 2024
Golden steer has been boasted as a mainstay of excellence for decades. After hearing some people say it‚Äôs just a ‚Äútourist trap‚Äù with overpriced food. my wife and I wanted to experience Golden Steer first hand. Those who say this could not be MORE WRONG! Golden Steer is an experience EVERYONE should enjoy. not just tourists. From the moment you enter. you are greeted with ‚Äúhappy to serve‚Äù staff that all work as a team to make your meal. and your time there incredibly memorable. We shared Seafood stuffed mushrooms. and Alaskan King crab cocktail. which were both amazing and very fairly priced. Only $47 for both. We then shared the prime rib. and added an additional appetizer of Shrimp De Jonghe as part of our entree. 4 giant shrimp covered in a buttery sauce so delicious you might want to dip your steak or prime rib in. Our side dishes were whipped mashed and the Sherry Cream mushrooms. Both were very delicious and again fairly priced. I have paid close to $20 for side dishes at other steak houses. These were only $14 each. We finished the evening off with the table side flamb√©ed Cherries Jubilee. which was both a flaming culinary show. and tasting delight. Overall we spent less than $200 before tax and tip and easily could have taken home leftovers if we didn‚Äôt have other plans following. NOT OVERPRICED in my opinion at all! Especially considering the PERFECT team-driven service that was prompt. detailed. private. and without unnecessary interruptions. Overall. we found the experience not to be just for tourists. There‚Äôs a reason Golden Steer has been highly rated and recommended since 1958. They do it right. and make your meal and experience memorable. Make a reservation early. weeks or months in advance to be safe. cause they go very quickly. Secret: If you don‚Äôt have a larger group. bar seating is first come first served and usually pretty obtainable at 4:30pm when they open. even without a reservation.,5,4,5,5,September 24 2024
I was so so excited so dine at golden steer. Me and my partner came to Las Vegas to dine at Golden Steer for 30th birthday all the way from England.  On arrival the restaurant did acknowledge we were dinging for my special birthday. When we were seated at our table the waiter also said ‚ÄúI hear your celebrating a birthday‚Äù and explained that it was my 30th and it was a dream of mine to dine at the golden steer.  We ordered the table side ceaser which was beautiful.  For our main we ordered 1 smaller fillet for me. the larger fillet for my partner. fries. mash. mac n cheese and the lobster tail.  The mash was not hot at all which I asked to be changed. the fries were hard in the middle which were also changed. The mash came back very quick but the fries didn‚Äôt come back until we were finished our meal so we left them which was a waste of money. My steak was absolutely beautiful but my partners wasn‚Äôt as nice as mine. The flavour and texture was completely different. The lobster was very tasty! As I was finishing my meal I found a hair inside my steak. I was so embarrassed as we had already had to address 2 issues. A waiter saw me pulling the hair out of my food so came over and took my steak away. Someone who looked like a manager came over and said he wouldn‚Äôt charge for the steak and gave us a free dessert to say sorry which was nice of him. The table of 2 next to us were also celebrating a birthday and the waiting brought there dessert out with candles and made a fuss. But apart from the conversation when we first walked into the restaurant they did absolutely nothing to acknowledge my birthday. Not a glass of Prosecco or a candle in my dessert. Overall we were really disappointed in our experience and left feeling very upset.,2,2,2,4,September 24 2024
The entire experience was wonderful. Steaks (coming from a Texan) were incredible. Servers were very knowledgeable and kind. Caesar salad was very good as well. Will definitely try to get a reservation next time we are in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,September 24 2024
Great experience.  Good staff. Nice setting. Great food.,5,4,5,5,September 24 2024
Truly exceptional dining experience! We will be back!,5,5,5,5,September 24 2024
The service was outstanding and the food was great! Chris our head waiter was amazing and attentive! The entity staff was great! We will definitely come back.,5,5,5,5,September 24 2024
Golden Steer did not disappoint!! Worth the 3 month wait!! The service was unbelievable. They are all in sync to make sure you are taken care of. The food what can I say it was a double chefs kiss!!  We wanted the Golden Steer experience!! We started off with Shrimp De Johnge. table side Caesar salad and We all ordered the petite filet and lobster Wow! The filet melted in your mouth and the Lobster perfectly cooked. Prime Mac n cheese. whipped potatoes and sweet cream corn! And for desert table side Banana Foster!! Everything was delicious and seasoned! Thank you Golden Steer for making my son‚Äôs 30th Birthday unbelievable!!!,5,5,5,5,September 23 2024
Perhaps it was an off night. the longhorn steak was  ordered medium well done. however it was very dry. The Lobster and sides were good.  Caesar salad was excellent. Overall experience didn‚Äôt meet my cuisine expectations.,3,2,5,5,September 23 2024
We were so looking forward to our dinner at the Golden Steer.  and we were not disappointed.   The service was off the charts from the moment we stepped to the door.  The feel of old Vegas hits you when you walk into the bar area.  Everyone made you feel important and ready to serve.  The food was amazing.  Table side Cesar salad with the story of how it was created just added to the experience.  Everyone there was stopping to ask if we needed anything but not intrusive.   The prime rib and steaks were as good as promised and I won‚Äôt ever have a better lobster tail in my life.  We capped it off with the table side cherries jubilee.  The meal and experience was with every penny.   This is a Vegas bucket list item for anyone who appreciates fine dining.,5,5,5,5,September 23 2024
Excellent food and service. Great place to go for an old school Vegas feel. You can easily picture the Rat pack. various mobsters and Elvis in this place. It‚Äôs pricey but worth it.,5,5,5,5,September 23 2024
The service and food was great. Best steak ive had in las vegas. The banana foster was super good. Highly recommend,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
Quality Steaks and awesome Banana Foster table side dessert. We will definitely be back!!  Thank you Golden Steer!!!!,5,5,5,5,September 22 2024
Best restaurant in Vegas!!! Service unbelievable and food was outstanding!!,5,5,5,5,September 21 2024
It was an amazing dinner experience. They put us in a separate room and we were treated so well. Great teamwork. The filets and lobster tails were FABULOUS. CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK!!!,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
Unique establishment! Amazing steaks with great sides.,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
By far an amazing experience and to learn about the history of the restaurant. The service was top notch and highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
"Great service by friendly. and seemingly happy waitstaff. Food is great as expected. Pricey. but it's Las Vegas. A little noisy with ""Old School"" vibe.  Lobster. Ceasar. Sides and Desert were great as advertised.  Only thing that seemed out of place pricewise was $20.00 for a well cocktail.",5,5,5,3,September 20 2024
The food was so good and the service was great as well. The table side Caesar salad really filled us up.,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
Great food great service and amazing atmosphere! .,5,5,5,5,September 20 2024
We booked in to celebrate my 40th birthday. They had a note on the reservation of it. and all the waiters knew and wished myself a happy birthday when walking to the table. The food was perfect as you would expect from the reviews,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Perhaps my expectations were too high when I made my reservation here.  The service was impeccable although the noice level made it difficult for me. at times. to understand the wait staff.   The food was ok. but not special. as I had expected.  Next time I would avoid the garlic butter topping on my 12oz filet.  To me. it seemed to detract from the taste of the meat.   I can now remove the Golden Steer from my bucket list.,4,3,5,4,September 19 2024
"I chose this restaurant due to all the Las Vegas influencers posting about the giant lobster tails & ribeye steak. While I did find the lobster was tasty. I should have gone with the ribeye instead of the filet.  We asked for the filet well done. and if they were not able to do this for us. the server should have told us it was not possible. We didn't mention the under-done filet because no one ever came to check on us until everyone was done eating. The members of our party that had the ribeye thought it was tasty & prepared medium rare when we were offered it at ""medium rare plus"". Again. we did not see our server until the entrees were eaten.  They were extremely busy & at least our waters were kept full.",4,4,5,3,September 19 2024
Awesome experience from the food to the service & presentation.,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Great experience. great food. great service. Make your reservation way in advance!!!!!,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Fantastic environment . great staff and I highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,September 19 2024
Great service and good food!! Would go back for sure!,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
Great service Staff was very attentive. Water glass was always full. Exterior of building could use a little love. while interior was beyond expectations. Food was amazing. The table side Caesar salad presentation was informative and enjoyable.   Well worth the cost.,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
Wonderful experience at the Golden Steer! Booked a reservation for my husbands birthday 4 months prior and were sat promptly. The hostess was very welcoming and wished my husband a happy birthday. Our servers were very professional and accommodating. We ordered two cocktails and they were both delicious. Our appetizers were the escargot and crab cocktail. both were so good. The Caesar salad was made right at our table and it was the best Caesar I‚Äôve ever had. I will definitely be making my own soon. We shared the dinner for two and couldn‚Äôt finish it was so much food. We ended up getting desert and they brought out a cheesecake with a candle for my husband without being asked. Overall a wonderful evening!,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
The Golden steer steakhouse never disappoints! We ordered the table side. Caesar salad. which is phenomenal. We had a perfectly cooked medium fillet with a petite lobster tail that was big enough for two people to share and cooked to perfection.  We finished the evening with the table side Bananas Foster! Yummy! The staff is so attentive. combine that with the ambience. Perfect.,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024
The food and service was awesome!!! Will be coming back in DeDecember with my sister in law. Would really like a both again. Thanks,5,5,5,5,September 18 2024

Great food Caesar salad was lovely and the steak was delicious,5,5,5,5,September 17 2024
We waited 5mos for a table and it was semi worth it. The bone marrow was delicious (first time ever had it) the steak and lobster were average definitely not worth $530 for two.,5,3,5,5,September 17 2024
We lucked out and found a reservation for the next day (must have been a cancellation). 2nd time here and again an amazing dinner. Love the ambiance. service was fantastic and the food amazing.

Everything was literal perfection. The food. the service. one person in our group even forgot their to go bag and our server james ran out of the restaurant to give it to him. Golden Steer is the pinnacle of dining.,5,5,5,5,September 16 2024
The whole restaurant is over hyped.  Food had no seasoning.  Lobster tail was dry and overcooked.  Steak was tough.   Terrible.,2,1,4,3,September 16 2024

Loved our dinner at the Golden Steer. Food was great and the service was incredible.,5,5,5,5,September 14 2024
The food wasn‚Äôt bad. not great and definitely not worth having to make reservations so far in advance. If you want to spend money just to spend money go there. There is many better place out there for sure. Very overrated. And the service is very mediocre.,3,4,1,3,September 13 2024
Food was very good!! Overpriced but worth it. Had to wait 25 min even though we had a reservation. they made up for the inconvenience by giving us a free app.  Old school Vegas ambiance,4,5,5,4,September 13 2024
Oysters were not good. Very fatty.  Steak and lobster was good.  Little noisy.  Service was great!!,4,4,5,5,September 13 2024
Golden Steer never disappointed me. Fantastic wait and service staff. I took my team to dinner and they want me to book our reservation for next year already.,5,5,5,5,September 13 2024

The Filet was top notch! Service was impeccable! Great place with an amazing atmosphere. Wait staff was super friendly and attentive. Not sure you could replicate the experience we had.,5,5,5,5,September 12 2024
Best steak we‚Äôve ever had! Absolutely phenomenal! Only thing less than perfect was the wine we ordered for dinner that came out when we had almost finished eating. But overall GREAT service!,5,5,4,5,September 12 2024
Hands down this place has the best steaks! The ambiance. the food. and the service are all above anywhere that I have been.,5,5,5,5,September 12 2024
Food was fine. I think I as expecting more. Crab legs were barely warm and butter was cool to dip in. Baked potato way over cooked. Steaks were good.,4,3,4,3,September 12 2024
You are thrown back in time in this steakhouse.  Dress code strictly enforced. we saw a man actually confronted and had to remove a ball cap or leave. So that was good!  $120 crab legs were average at best. lobster was huge but dry and overcooked. We also had a steak at our table and it was fantastic. No one asked us how it was‚Ä¶ Cocktails were very good and expresso martinis were a good dessert!  In my opinion there were way to many servers and busters and hosts and mob bosses(lol) walking around. It made the whole dining room chaotic . Sadly we probably won‚Äôt return.,3,4,5,5,September 12 2024
A special place. Excellent food and service. I have only 2 complaints. 1) It's very expensive. Dinner for 2 cost me $638 after 25% tip. The fillet/lobster tail plate alone was $200! It was delicious but holy moly! No wonder they don't list the price on their menu. 2) Dress code. It was clearly posted on their website and reservation confirmation: smart casual dress. It even said they would deny service to those who don't comply. We were surrounded by people wearing shorts and t-shirts. It's disappointing that some people are so disrespectful. If you're going to set a minimum dress code. enforce it! It's not fair to other diners who treat this as a special place and dining there a special occasion. We waited 4 months for this reservation. We'll be back and I hope other diners will adhere to the dress code next time!,5,5,5,5,September 11 2024
This experience was a 10 out of 10. From start to finish. The ambience of the place is unique and we loved it. The food was insanely delicious. hands down the best lobster we‚Äôve had thus far. Our servers were very friendly and made every bit of the time we spent there enjoyable. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,5,5,5,5,September 11 2024
Servers were wonderful. Food was top notch. Caesar  salad is a must.,5,5,5,5,September 11 2024
Amzaing. hard for a restaurant to live up to its hype but the Golden Steer did! Everything was 5 stars. High high recommend,5,5,5,5,September 11 2024
Amazing food & staff customer service was beyond amazing,5,5,5,5,September 11 2024

Absolutely! Here's a glowing review of The Golden Steer:  I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Golden Steer. and I can't recommend it highly enough. From the moment I walked in. I was greeted with warm. welcoming service that set the tone for a fantastic evening. The ambiance was classic and inviting. with a touch of old-school charm that made me feel right at home.  The star of the show. of course. was the food. The Golden Steer truly excels in delivering a top-notch steakhouse experience. The 24oz rib-eye I ordered was cooked to perfection‚Äîtender. juicy. and full of flavor. The sides were equally impressive; the garlic mash the mushrooms were both outstanding.  But it wasn't just the food that made the experience memorable. The attention to detail and the overall atmosphere made it clear that The Golden Steer is a place where guests are genuinely valued. The staff was attentive without being overbearing. and their knowledge of the menu was spot on.  Whether you're a steak aficionado or just looking for a great meal in a classic setting. The Golden Steer is a must-visit. It's a place where you can count on a consistently exceptional dining experience. I can't wait to return!,5,5,5,5,September 10 2024
Service was excellent as well as the food. The place was everything we had read it would be. Felt like we were back in time.  Caesar salad and cherries jubilee table side were delicious. I have a new favorite dessert. Will be back when we go to Vegas again.,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
The Golden Steer is the best steakhouse we have ever been too. Highly recommend! The food and the staff are A+,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
A great experience.  While not fancy looking outside its got a real vegas charm inside and a great setting.  Food is really good with the ceaser salad starter made at the table. Steak was amazing and sides and desert too.  But it is very expensive! Would go again but it's not cheap!,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
Very nice . they were very accommodating after finding out our reservation was was day later .,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
Whenever I'm going to Las Vegas I'm going to Golden Steer.  I booked my latest reservation on 9/8 the moment I heard I was going to a conference in Vegas.  This is my only true go to in Vegas.  The food. the service. the ambiance. the history... It's got it all.  I'm already craving my next trip!,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
Our group ordered a variety of dishes including the tomahawk. which was cooked to perfection. no complaints at all. the staff was very professional. Best experience we have had in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
Amazing service and the food taste amazing . It lived up to all the expectations . I highly recommend trying,5,5,5,4,September 9 2024
Amazing!!!! Top notch!! Food and service is incredible!,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
The Service. the quality of the food. the Ambience unbeatable!,5,5,5,5,September 9 2024
Pricey. but quite delicious! And the service was impeccable.,5,5,5,5,September 8 2024
Drinks - The best Old Fashioned with 12 Year Whistle Pig. Our waiter was very knowledgeable on whiskeys when I asked for a suggestion for my 2nd round. 5/5  Salad - First time trying the table side salad. I‚Äôm not a Caesar salad fan at all. but this salad was very flavorful. I just wish the salad wasn‚Äôt drenched in it. Perfect dressing tho. 4/5  Dinner - I had the Prime Rib - English Cut cooked to a medium temperature. I was highly disappointed with it. It was cooked to perfection. but it really was lacking in flavor. I was hoping for a crust of seasoning and there wasn‚Äôt any. 2/5 My wife had the Shorthorn 16 oz cooked to a Med-Rare temperature. It was cooked perfectly and had loads of flavor. One of the best steaks she‚Äôs had. 5/5  Dessert - Bananas Foster. Made table side and it was delicious. We were also given a free slice of cheesecake because of my birthday. 5/5  Overall a great experience. Waiters constantly checking in and having great conversation.,4,4,5,5,September 8 2024
My husband and I had a spectacular dinner last night. It was his first time here. which was extra special since he was born and raised in Las Vegas. The rib eye was exceptional. We would highly recommend the table side Caesar salad. It was phenomenal. The sommelier recommended an exceptional wine that paired with every portion of our meal. We can not recommend it enough and are already looking forward to our next meal.,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
Food was excellent and so was the service. Overall very pleased.,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
Really worth the cost and an awesome experience! A bucket list restaurant.,5,5,5,5,September 7 2024
By far the best steak in Las Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
We had an amazing dinner there. The steak was cooked perfectly  and the lobster tail was to die for.  Topped off with the bananas foster. Best meal I've had in my life. Don't hesitate to go there,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
Staff was so polite and food was on point!  Will be back again!,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
You come here for an experience. The food and service are outstanding. The French Onion soup is one of the best I have ever had. I had a petite filet and shrimp du jonghe. Oh my!!!  We finished with the table side banana foster. It is incredibly expensive with wine. apps. dinner and dessert. Definitely a special occasion type of place.,5,5,5,5,September 6 2024
Best way to spend your anniversary is at the world famous golden steer,5,5,5,4,September 5 2024
I was expecting to be blown away / it was ok - expensive for the experience- wine is overpriced - herb and rye is much better,4,4,3,4,September 5 2024
Amazing food. The twice baked potato and steak was divine! Wasn‚Äôt thrilled with our server Alfredo who looked like he hated his job. Killed the customer service for us. unfortunately.,5,5,2,5,September 5 2024
The service and food are outstanding. Well worth the price.   The parking. unfortunately. is a different story.  We went to an early dinner and still had a bad time finding a spot to park.,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
The food was absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared. The staff was attentive and helpful. I had high expectations based on everything I had heard and read and they surpassed even my high expectations. Definitely a must try if you‚Äôre in Las Vegas!!!! Get the Caesar salad!!!,5,5,5,5,September 5 2024
We tried to get a reservation here for quite some time!! Finally we tried it out! The ambiance and staff were amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our steaks. We ordered the escargot. as it is a house special. and it was not good. The ceaser salad was incredible (but expensive). I also had the crab with my steak and it was good. but very expensive for two legs. The sides (spinach and broccoli) were also so. so. as was the cheesecake. I think this is a steakhouse that you need to try at least once. But. just get the ceaser salad and a nice steak. No need to indulge on anything else. We have eaten at other steak houses (Gallagher and Jean George) and found their meals better and less expensive. But. the old school vibe here is pretty cool.,4,4,5,5,September 4 2024
Lived up to expectations. excellent all around. Highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,September 4 2024
The golden steer lived up to its billing. This has to be one of the great Las Vegas experiences. It combines the history of las vegas with a plaque alongside many of the booths showing you that you are sitting at Betty Grable's regular table or if you're lucky. Frank Sinatra. and first class steaks and service.,5,5,5,5,September 4 2024
I hadn't been back in years and it was still exactly like I remembered. Everything was awesome from the moment we walked in - still the best restaurant in Vegas,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
Ambience and service was great.  The old Vegas feel and interesting to hear about the history of restaurant.  We had salads. prime rib. and pasta.  All very good.  Definitely a place you have to eat at once.,4,4,5,5,September 3 2024
Meal and service were outstanding. Tableside Caesar was huge. enough for 4 people! Best steak I‚Äôve ever had!,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
Excellent service and exceptional food. We booked 5 months ahead and was well worth the wait. Will definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
I had reservations for this place months in advance. I grew up in Las Vegas and had always wanted to try this place. Maybe my expectations led me to my mediocre review. I just feel like I spent an exuberant amount of money $900+ for a party of 5 (one a child) and the quality of food did not justify the price. If the meal had been half the price. my review would probably be better.,3,3,5,3,September 3 2024
Amazing dining experience at this iconic restaurant with my beautiful wife for our anniversary. The entire staff were welcoming and friendly and made our dining experience one that we will never forget. We ordered a bottle of house Cabernet from Italy. table side Caesar Salad. 8 oz filets. mash potatoes. and topped  it off with table side cherry jubilee. It was all very delicious and we highly recommend dining here. We will be back!,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
We traveled in from Louisiana to watch the LSU/USC game. It was also our 24th anniversary. When I searched the best steakhouse in Las Vegas the Golden Steer was the people‚Äôs choice and were they ever so right. The food and service was top notch! We did the table side Caesar Salad and split the 24 oz bone in rib-eye. Absolutely delicious! Highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,September 3 2024
I would not recommend this steak house in Las Vegas unless you‚Äôre going just to say you‚Äôve been to the Golden Steer. The service was sub pair. at a place with 3 servers I should never have an empty drink. the waiter actually forgot a drink in the beginning and we had to remind him. The bread was ok. We ordered the Seafood tower. the Caesar salad was really good along with the presentation and the baked potato was great. I ordered the 8oz filet with crab legs. The filet was cooked perfect. The one crab leg was cut down the middle and the plate was 155. Not worth it. Our waiter forgot a dessert but guessed and brought out an extra saying you can just keep it. ha ha. then never brought the ordered dessert to the person. The place itself is nice in the inside. very vintage. We try to go to different steak houses every where we go and this one was not one to remember which is extremely disappointing because it was the most expensive so far.,3,3,3,5,September 2 2024
Old school Vegas feel with top notch customer service. Prime rib was awesome and Australian lobster tail was huge. Get the bananas foster for dessert. Served via tableside presentation and so worth it. Will definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
I was so looking forward to this experience. We were  party of four for dinner service. My husband and I ordered the dinner for two. The table side caesar salad was excellent! One of the best I have ever tasted. Our longhorn steak was fatty. hard to chew and not the quality that I would expect. The lobster was huge but rather tough. I was disappointed overall. as I had super high expectations for this dining experience. Our dinner mates each had the filet and they said it was amazing. I would not visit again. as the cost versus quality is not equal. The service was impeccable. Eric was amazing.,4,4,5,4,September 2 2024
Wonderful experience and would definitely recommend anyone to try this place out. I ordered the longhorn steak and lobster for two. Great deal. comes with sides and starter which was delicious. The server was very knowledgeable with the history of the restaurant which was also a great touch to the experience. Thank you!,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
Service and atmosphere was good. The table side caesar salad. the filet  and the mushrooms were amazing. The lobster was overcooked and the crab legs came out cold. The butter is like an oil too. It wasn't rich tasting for the seafood. Overall the experience was amazing. I don't know that it was worth the cost again.,4,4,5,5,September 2 2024
We will dine here every time we are in Vegas. Phenomenal!,5,5,5,5,September 2 2024
Justin and Chris were great! They both provided excellent customer service and answered all of our questions. Thank you!,5,4,5,4,September 2 2024
Our group was looking forward to our experience here celebrating our friends 60th. Unfortunately. they didn‚Äôt measure up. 3 of the steaks were cooked wrong. The mashed potatoes were served cold. The ambience in our room was blah. We came to sit in the booths for the experience. The best part of the meal was the Caesar Salad. Maybe it was an off night. But there are way better steakhouses in Vegas.,2,2,3,2,August 31 2024
Fantastic food and service.  one of the best meals I've had. but you're going to pay for it.,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
Amazing as always and of course the most fantastic service! It was my husband‚Äôs 50th and they made it so special.,5,5,5,5,August 31 2024
. The wait staff are courteous. friendly and helpful. food was great and pricing was reasonable in relation the quality. Portions are giant! Overall everything was great about this restaurant aside from two things. The wine selection was highly overpriced ( $169 for a bottle you can get in the store for $35) and the hostess who checked us in. Our reservation was at 8:30 and we checked in at 8:12. We waited and at 8:50 we had to check on our table and it turned out our hostess screwed up gave our table away! However wait staff more than made up for it and they did give us a free meatball appetizer to apologize for the inconvenience. (Lol),4,4,5,4,August 30 2024
Golden Steer‚Äôs service. quality. and atmosphere are unmatched. The entire experience was fabulous.,5,5,5,5,August 30 2024
Golden steer never disappoints. Food was 10/10 service 10/10 (although our main server was not the nicest),5,5,5,5,August 30 2024
Highly recommended to ourselves. in addition zero complaint or concern from us.  The ambiance. The Restaurant was delightful. the food and service / Servers was a pure delight. Again we would recommend the restaurant going on our experience Thank you Golden Steer.,5,5,4,4,August 29 2024
Amazing!!  Great food and service.  Will definitely go back again.,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Great Service and Great Food  Lobster Tails are great English Cut Prime Rib was a bit thin but well cooked,5,5,5,3,August 29 2024
This was my family‚Äôs second time at The Golden Steer and everything was amazing. Staff was exceptional. food was outstanding. The only thing I regret was not saving room for a cherry jubilee!,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Loved the old school Las Vegas ambiance of the restaurant. The wait staff was spot on with taking care of you making you feel like you were honored royalty. The food was good also with large portions. Our party of three ordered the stuffed mushrooms to share for the starting appetizer. We each had the Caesars salad (which was huge and almost a meal in itself). two of us ordered the king crab legs. and the third person ordered the NY steak. We also ordered a side order of twice stuffed potatoes and asparagus that we shared. Would have liked to have ordered the bananas foster for dessert. but we were too full. Will definitely return on another trip to Las Vegas. The Golden Steer is a great place to go to for a special night out. Reservations are very hard to get. so be sure to book your dinner way in advance.,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Golden Steer never disappoints. I‚Äôve been coming here for about 10 years now and always visit when I‚Äôm in town. It‚Äôs harder to get a reservation now but still worth it. Food is so good. the service is outstanding and I love so much that they keep the retro vibe and decor. Top notch.,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Food. service and atmosphere are absolutely amazing!!,5,5,5,5,August 29 2024
Not as good as expected. The steak is more to heavy taste side. Appetizer is better than the main course. Best is the banana foster. Value is a bit over price. but service is good and friendly. 80 out of 100 point.,4,4,5,4,August 29 2024
We celebrated my husbands birthday dinner here and were so excited to get a reservation. The food was exquisite and the service was impeccable! Definitely a must try when in Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,August 28 2024
Service was great. Table side Caesar was fantastic. Tomahawk was good. but not the best I‚Äôve had in Vegas.,4,4,5,5,August 28 2024
I brought my fianc√©e in for her last meal as my fianc√©e ‚Äîwe were married the next day. She had never been before. and I wanted her to experience one of my favorite places to eat. The food was excellent. as always; the staff was kind and efficient. and the dessert they gave us was delicious. I will be back in DeDecember for another visit!,5,5,5,4,August 28 2024
Outstanding. so glad I managed to get a booking for this restaurant. Please if you get the opportunity. book and have your dinner here. It will not disappoint,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
5/5 in every aspect! the hype is real and the food was amazing. Couldn‚Äôt enjoy it as long as I wanted because I left my phone on a valet machine on the strip.. :( regardless one of the best dinners i have ever had! James was amazing and gave great recommendations!,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
Very nice spot and probably the best food in Vegas. My only negative t thing to say salt it is that it‚Äôs not in the best area. But the food is SOOOO good I‚Äôll definitely be returning. More photos out IG @Collins2Collins,5,5,5,4,August 27 2024
Great splurge night out with my husband. Food was delicious! Service was amazing very attentive.,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
I specifically planned this trip to Vegas to eat at Golden Steer. As always. it was well worth it. This was my second visit to Golden Steer in the past six months. It helps that I only need to jump on a short flight when a reservation opens up. I was able to bring my parents and sister this time and they all highly enjoyed their dining experience. Our fest included Fried Calamari to start. Caesar salad (must try) table side. Prime Rib. Rib Eye. King Crab. Twice Baked potato and Whipped Potatoes. I highly recommend everything mentioned! For dessert we shared a Cheesecake. Banana Foster table side. and Spumoni Bomba. Dessert was fantastic! Definitely looking forward to returning as soon as a reservation opens up. Thank you to all the hard working staff at Golden Steer!,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
James. our waiter. and all the staff were polite. efficient and timely. Food was out of this world and cooked to perfection.  We spoiled ourselves for our wedding anniversary and the staff I. Turned spoiled us.,5,5,5,5,August 27 2024
It's my favorite restaurant in the US. The best most personal service you will ever experience. The steaks are fantastic. perfectly cooked. and the matre d butter is worth the upgrade. Sherry cream mushrooms were perfectly balanced. Bananas foster was a perfect way to end the meal. It's pretty expensive but worth it to celebrate a special occasion.,5,5,5,5,August 26 2024
Best restaurant I have ever been to in Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,August 26 2024
S√∫per buena comida de 10. y s√∫per buen servicio. car√≠simo !! Pero lo vale,5,5,5,4,August 26 2024
I‚Äôve been here twice now for dinner. always great service and excellent food. Golden Steer goes above and beyond to make your dinner the very best!,5,5,5,5,August 26 2024
Very good. Nice presentation and food. Will come again in future trips,5,5,5,5,August 25 2024
We are locals and this was our first time eating here and we wish we would have came sooner. The food. the service. and the atmosphere were all great. We enjoyed everything that came out and we definitely will come back. Tables are hard to get but luckily a reservation opened up for us. 10/10.,5,5,5,5,August 25 2024
Such a great atmosphere!  The food was amazing and large portions.  We had 6 in our group and the waiter was very attentive.  Definitely will be back!,5,5,5,5,August 25 2024
The 4 month wait was well worth it! My husband and I have been following them for over a year and decided it was time to visit! Everything from the ambiance. service. food. and drinks was immaculate! I am ready to book my next trip to Vegas just to dine at the Golden Steer again!,5,5,5,5,August 25 2024
Had Anniversary dinner with friends on Friday night. The food and service were fabulous !! It was kind of noisy and made it difficult to carry on a normal conversation. but. it quieted down eventually. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening Thank you,5,5,5,4,August 24 2024
Booked this restaurant five months in advance for a group of 8 and we were all extremely excited given the hype and the reviews. I visit Vegas 3-4 times a year and have been fortunate to eat a number of amazing restaurants. Overall it was kind of a disappointing. Steaks were just average for what I was expecting. The ribeye was pretty good but the filets were meh. Lobster tails were large but were kind of tough. The crab legs were the one thing that everybody really enjoyed. Appetizers. sides and dessert were all just average. The ambience of the restaurant and the presentation of the tableside caesar salad and bananas foster were top notch. Surprisingly the service wasn‚Äôt all that great either as we actually had to flag a waiter down to order another round of drinks. I‚Äôm glad I finally was able to dine at the golden steer. however. given the other steakhouse options in Vegas. for $500 a couple. there is no reason to go back.,3,3,3,5,August 24 2024
Made my reservation 6 months ahead of time. Was well worth the wait. The dinner for 2 was more than enough food to feed both my gf and I. Will go again.,5,5,5,5,August 24 2024
excellent service. Restaurant is an institution.  Not cheap but worth a visit.  Hard to get a resie.,5,4,5,4,August 24 2024
Beautiful place. great atmosphere. The steaks are amazing. Great place to relive the Old Vegas from the Rat Pack days!,5,5,5,5,August 24 2024
Phenomenal food and great service! We would definitely revisit!,5,5,4,5,August 23 2024
Was as good as the hype ‚Ä¶ outstanding food and service,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Crab cakes-excellent! Some of the best we‚Äôve ever had. Bone-in ribeye-cooked and seasoned to perfection. Twice baked potatoes-fabulous. Lobster-huge and delicious. Cherries jubilee-decadent. But I think we mentioned that it was an anniversary and no one said or gave anything extra.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
This was our first dining experience at the Golden Steer and we were not disappointed.  The service is amazing. friendly. attentive and very helpful. The food is delicious we tried just about everything but dessert because we were just too full.  The fish is tender and fresh and the prime rib well prepared and delicious. They also have a great bar menu. We were very happy with our visit.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
The food and experience was amazing!!  Can‚Äôt wait to go again when we are in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,August 23 2024
Wonderful service! History and atmosphere is great!,4,3,5,5,August 22 2024
One of the best Steakhouses in Vegas for a reason. Service was amazing! Best Mac&Cheese in town. Steak was cooked to perfection. Shoutout to Tony the bartender for incredible service and amazing drinks.,5,4,5,5,August 22 2024
Overall it was ok. I must admit it was a bit of a let down Rolls: plain ol grocery store rolls Calamari: breading was excellent but Calamari was chewy Caesar‚Äôs Salad: excellent! Mashed potatoes: excellent Chicken dish: amazing Rib steak: nothing special just average Sea Bass: a little bit dry Lobster: most of it was good but for some reason the ends were over cooked Overall it was a good experience but for the price it should have a been better,4,4,4,5,August 22 2024
Great steak and lobster tail. Took friends and it was their first time there and they loved it!,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024
A absolute must If you can get in. Awesome Definitely would recommend üëå.  A GREAT DINING EXPERIENCE.  Thank you üòä,5,5,5,5,August 22 2024

Outstanding!  Service and staff were incredible. food maybe the best lobster tail and steak I‚Äôve had in Vegas.  Definitely worth the price!,5,5,5,5,August 21 2024
We waited 3 months to come to Vegas for the Golden Steer and they did not disappoint.  The ambiance was wonderful. calling of memories of celebrities and mobsters past.  The service was immaculate and the food was spectacular.  Absolutely enjoyed the experience.  After dinner our server gave us a tour of the restaurant and its history.  I will definitely go again.,5,5,5,5,August 20 2024
Absolutely THE BEST steakhouse in Vegas. Too many reasons to promote this establishment. but food. service and quality are definitely  the top 3. If you've never been. you need to go. Total package!!!!,5,5,5,5,August 20 2024
Tomahawk steak for two nothing but fat on it mac & cheese was bland so was potatoes.,2,1,1,5,August 20 2024
Wonderful experience. the waiters are knowledgeable and attentive. A classic steakhouse experience!,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
Awesome‚Ä¶ pricey. but must try at least once‚Ä¶. The food and especially the service was outstanding.,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
this is always an amazing experience. It‚Äôs not an every day meal as you‚Äôd expect. but for special occasions and assuming you have enough for thought to get a reservation. this is a go to place.,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
We were celebrating a birthday in our group. We were seated in the Sinatra  booth and it was a treat. The food was fabulous. we had table side Caesar Salad. baked potatoes and we had a petit filet with shrimp and a porterhouse to share among 4 people. It was so good. plenty for us all. The service was impeccable. A true experience.,5,5,5,5,August 19 2024
Good ribeye. Substandard ceasar salad and sides. cream spinach and twice baked potato.   Both sides were small in quantity and little to no flavor. Compensation for the sides was given. Server did a great job of matching our dietary preferences to the menu. the food didn‚Äôt deliver anything memorable. Won‚Äôt be going back.,3,2,3,2,August 18 2024
Best service and ambience! The food was amazing and definitely worth the value to try once.,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
We‚Äôve lived in Vegas over 30 years. We‚Äôve been here a number of times. We‚Äôre always surprised at how this place has maintained its level of excellence for so long. The service was fantastic and the steaks were delicious. All of the sides were scrumptious. Definitely recommend.Ôøº,5,5,5,5,August 18 2024
Enjoyed our experience at Golden Steer once again. We were seated at the Joe DiMaggio booth this time instead of a table in the middle of the larger dining room. Our server. Bryan. was the same one that took care of us during our first visit. He and all the staff that came around to check on us and serve our meal were so friendly and informative.  We started with an onion soup and wedge salad then my husband and I both had rib eyes medium rare. but mine had the maitre d butter. And finally we finished our meal again with the table side Bananas Foster. It‚Äôs a nice experience and they always explain every step of the process. And just like everything else that we had. It‚Äôs so delicious!,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
One of the best steaks and lobster around Vegas! Great food and excellent service!,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
The restaurant lived up to my memories of long ago. Impeccabke service. great cocktails. and presentation. Food was 5 star. Can't wait to return.,5,5,5,5,August 17 2024
Holy Cow. I think it was the best dinner I‚Äôve ever had. The table side Caesar  salad. carving. cherries jubilee. You just can‚Äôt top it. The server. I beleive his name was Bryan was extremely helpful with us selecting the best way to try a few different things. The ribeye. strip and lobster tail were absolutely fantastic. They really pride themselves on presentation. We were there for a 21st birthday and they made it feel like you were the king of the world. We will definitely be back. Be prepared to drop a little bit of change but that‚Äôs anywhere in Vegas lol. A truly top of the line experience.,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
This was all of our first times eating at Golden Steer. It was excellent. Everyone said their food was delicious. It got a little loud in our room but great atmosphere. A can‚Äôt miss place.,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
Caesar salad was incredible and worth every penny.  The service was impeccable - they work as a team and never miss a beat.  Steak was very good sides and bread were alright.,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
Awesome experience being in a booth Marilyn Monroe sat in! Food was great. definitely do not skip the table side ceasar salad!,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024
Bucket list restaurant. All was excellent. Ali our server was beyond amazing in every way. We will be back!,5,5,5,5,August 16 2024

Service was flawless.food was outstanding. Pricey but worth it,5,5,5,5,August 15 2024
Las night was our first time at golden steer and we were very excited to try out this highly recommended restaurant. We had been trying to book a table for months for my husband‚Äôs birthday. The food was amazing. We ordered some appetizers we both had the jumbo Western Australia lobster tail and the steak. The caesar salad was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Just amazing everything was amazing.,3,5,2,4,August 15 2024
The Food and Drinks were excellent! The wait staff makes sure your dining experience is one to remember. I liked the old school decor and atmosphere. Highly recommended!!,5,5,5,5,August 15 2024
Every time my father and I go out to eat. no matter where we are in the world. we always end up talking about our experience at the Golden Steer. It's hands down my favorite restaurant in the U.S. ‚Äî a place where the atmosphere. lighting. and service all come together to create an unforgettable evening. The food is exceptional. top-tier in every way. and everyone who took care of us made our night. We can‚Äôt wait to go back and relive those memories.,5,5,5,5,August 15 2024
We were celebrating two birthdays and told front desk on checking but nothing was done. disappointed. Food was good. very loud. hard to talk,4,5,4,3,August 15 2024
Fantastic Meal and Great Atmosphere.  Everyone enjoyed their choice of entrees and the table side Caesar Salad was great.  Can't wait to go back again.,5,5,5,5,August 15 2024
Fantastic food and a great anniversary experience for my girlfriend and I!,5,5,5,5,August 15 2024
Loved the food. taste awesome. Delicious! Very pricey.,5,5,5,4,August 14 2024
It was awesome! Two thumbs up to the entire service team. Food was on point! The entire experience was phenomenal. Fantastic atmosphere. staff and experience!,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
Food. Drinks. Service. ambiance and the brief History Lesson(asked for ) were all amazing.,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
The entire experience from beginning to end was exceptional! The service was exceedingly exceptional. as was the food and ambiance!,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
Best meal we have ever had! Fantastic experience!,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
No hats allowed. didn‚Äôt read the email they sent but they do tell you this. The hype about this place was very high. so this is why I rated the way I did. Filet was good but I‚Äôd say for the price. me and my significant other have had better.,2,3,4,4,August 14 2024
Truly unlike any other steakhouse around and its provenance throughout the years shows. Golden Steer warps you back to the good ol‚Äô days of classic fine dining with a zing that sings rat pack. It is unbelievable that a salad can taste just as delicious as any of the top tier steaks offered here. You need to go if you haven‚Äôt..,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
Highly overrated. It was good. but not great. For the price I expected great.,3,3,4,4,August 14 2024
Service is above and beyond wonderful from the doorman to the wait staff.  Pleasant and never in a hurry.  We throughly enjoyed our dining experience from the food and drink quality to the old world Vegas ambiance.  Get your reservations in early to enjoy this experience.,5,5,5,5,August 14 2024
Food was cold definitely not worth the price . What a disappointment,1,1,3,3,August 14 2024
over priced .  food is nothing spectacular.   enjoyed Don's Prime and Delmonico's a lot more.  Dark and outdated.  I get the concept of an old style but still could be a  little updated.  It was so dark you couldn't even read plaques on the walls under the pictures.,3,3,5,3,August 14 2024
Nothing outstanding. but overall quite enjoyable.  Thanks!,4,3,4,4,August 13 2024
Finally was able to get a reservation for my son‚Äôs 21st birthday and it was incredible!  The steak and lobster was phenomenal!  The Golden Steer did NOT disappoint!,5,5,5,5,August 13 2024
Horrible receptionist and customer service. I had a reservation for 7pm. The restaurant changed my res time an hour and 12 minutes before 7pm. When I arrived at 7 I was told that I CHANGED the time myself which was false and was gaslight into believing that to be true. We uncomfortably had to wait an additional 20ish minutes at the bar where we were told our appetizers would be moved to us. and never were. Besides that the Caesar salad was the highlight of the night. I would never return to this establishment after being lied to about the reservation time. Next time at least notify your patrons that Res time needs to be changed.,2,4,1,5,August 13 2024
Excellent food. great staff. awesome beverages !  This is an icon in Las Vegas and is a must do. However. you need to make reservations a few months in advance to be sure.,5,5,5,5,August 13 2024
Great ambiance ! Food was great and would like to go back to try tomahawk and crab legs,4,4,4,5,August 13 2024
Legendary venue Did not disappoint  Impeccable service Would repeat,5,5,5,4,August 13 2024
Absolutely love coming here. From the moment you step into the restaurant till you leave. nothing but professional and friendly staff. We have been coming here for two years. Had a wonderful meal again last night and look forward to coming back !,5,5,5,5,August 13 2024
Wonderful restaurant. Amazing staff. RICH history. I would come back!,5,5,5,5,August 12 2024
After having no luck for weeks. our group was able to get a last minute reservation while on our Vegas trip! I couldn‚Äôt be happier to have been able to have the Golden Steer dining experience. Everything from the decor to the service to the food was incredible!,5,5,5,5,August 12 2024
The food was incredible. Probably the best ribeye I‚Äôve ever had. Service was impeccable. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,August 12 2024
Overall an excellent cullinary experience.  We shared the petite filet and lobster which was out of this world.  The cream corn flavor was delicious sporting a hint of cinnamon.   For dessert. Bananas Foster which was prepared right at the table.  Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for fine dining although they do not seem to enforce their own dress code which was disappointing at such an upscale restaurant.,5,5,5,5,August 12 2024
Very attentive staff. working as a team to make sure your needs are met. Delicious dinner!,5,5,5,4,August 12 2024
Worth the adventure off the strip great time great food Ôøº,5,5,4,5,August 11 2024
In all honesty the food wasn‚Äôt worth the price. We basically paid 200 per plate. Atmosphere was nice and chilled but food and quality could have been better. Would I go back? Probably not.,3,2,3,3,August 11 2024
Awesome evening.  Great food!  Loved the lobster!,5,5,5,5,August 11 2024
Our dinner was nothing like our first experience.  Very disappointed. Then there was a loud obnoxious drunk lady next to us. Security tried to get her to go. I was looking forward to this dinner for 8 months. üòû,3,2,3,5,August 11 2024
The food was amazing! Cesar salad. lobster tail. steak cooked to perfection!! This is definitely a must try if you‚Äôre in Vegas!!,5,5,5,5,August 11 2024
Very nice atmosphere and great food. The service was great. even gave us a free appetizer for the wait to get the table.,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
No better place for a date night in Vegas for a special person or group of friends. Wow is all we can say. We will be back!,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
We had a great experience here. The food was over the top and the service was excellent.,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
This place is amazing and we will be back again no doubt. The Caesar salad. is a must get. definitely the best I have ever had. We got the ribeye and whipped potatoes. both incredible. We go to a lot of steakhouses and this is the new number 1. I gave it very good for value only because it‚Äôs pricey. Only thing that caught us off guard was the corkage fee being $75. online it stated it was $35. other than that it was perfect. I can‚Äôt recommend this place enough.,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
Overall amazing experience. A MUST when in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,August 10 2024
Food is above reproach! The staff are friendly and entertaining!,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Service was fantastic and the quality was amazing as always,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Amazing experience from the staff to the food to the actual ambiance it was incredible. Ask for a tour after your done eating!,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Amazing food from the soup. Caesar‚Äôs salad. the Longhorn and Lobster. Best food ever!! It is in my top 2 restaurants I have eat in my life and I travel a lot for work and have eaten in a lot of steakhouse.,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
The most amazing tomohawk. We shared the meal for two. Ceasar salad was the best we‚Äôve ever eaten. The side were Mac and cheese and broccoli all cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed the pepper corn sauce with steak. Would recommend any aussies coming to book this early. Staff and chefs are doing a fab job! We would 100% book next time.,5,5,5,5,August 9 2024
Amazing!! Food and serve were top notch! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,5,5,5,5,August 8 2024
"We have always wanted to try out the Golden Steer but reservations were always a challenge.  We luckily secured a reservation on a Tuesday at 930pm and gladly made it happen.  Ambience was nice and you could tell that it was a first class outfit. like many other steak houses in Las Vegas.  The calamari was one of the best I've had. the other appetizers were ok.  The caesar salad presentation were a nice touch and something we've never seen.  The filet. short steak. and prime rib were all above average.  Would definitely all come back and recommend but for one certain detail.  We all had old fashions as our cocktail of choice.  The waiter asked. would you like a cubed ice or crushed ice?  We didn't think much initially. but then that topic became a subject of interest as we asked.  who the heck asks for crushed ice with. their old fashion?  Ultimately. we tried to move on and joked that we would order glasses of wine with ice cubes in it with an umbrella.  The waiter's service the rest of the night was scrutinized by us to see if he matched the ""judgy"" profile that we thought.  He did.  I would post his name but will spare the little man.  We still tipped 20% and moved on.  Why let his support staff suffer or make it a thing.  Golden Steer. please take notice.",1,4,1,3,August 7 2024
An absolute must do dining experience when in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
Our server was not attentive or informative about our experience He did not go over the menu with us or explain any options   We got a dinner for 2 and were told you get a soup or salad & 2 sides.  I asked about the table side Cesar salad(which they are famous for) and he said  oh yeah you can get that instead of each of you getting a soup or salad   He should have offered that option and I am wondering what else he didn‚Äôt offer The food was good but not for the $ we spent.  I would not return.  The place is overrated.,2,4,2,3,August 7 2024
Everything was wonderful! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!,5,4,5,5,August 7 2024
I have wanted to visit for years. After several tries. I finally got a reservation. For the amount of money. it was a great experience to have one time. I wouldn't go back- I didnt think the cost point translated 100% into the value of food. The food wasn't bad but it also wasn't the best I've had. The staff is AMAZING. You should definitely go at least one time.,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
My husband and I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to enjoy your restaurant. We were visiting LV and celebrating our wedding anniversary. Golden Steer made our entire experience so enjoyable. My husband has a shellfish allergy and I am a shellfish lover. :) staff was accommodating in making sure our food was separated appropriately. Excellent experience from start to finish and already can‚Äôt wait to be back.,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
Service was spot on & the food was delicious! Best French onion soup I have ever eaten. Lobster was huge and scrumptious. Prime rib was amazing!!,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
The food and service are exceptional!  Great atmosphere as well - feels like Old Vegas with a lot of history.  Was celebrating my Fiancee's birthday and it was perfect!,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
Wow! A must do when in Vegas. Service is out of this world! Food was great!,5,5,5,5,August 7 2024
If you‚Äôre visiting this restaurant. chances are you know exactly why you are going. Food was amazing. portions are big and drinks were great. The Longhorn steak and lobster tail for two was ordered. the meat portion was big. that plate could easily feed four. The sides were creamed corn and the Mac and cheese. Overall this place was great. I would absolutely visit again.,5,5,5,5,August 6 2024
Ôøº The corn and broccoli was very underwhelming. The service was impeccable. I really do the test your payment process.,4,4,5,5,August 6 2024
Outstanding food: had Alaskan king crab. steak and lobster. Very expensive but superb. My advice is to drop the lobster as less special than other items. The sides are amazing: we had baked potato and mushrooms and they were extraordinary.,5,5,5,5,August 6 2024
Absolutely loved this steakhouse! Will always be coming here when in Vegas. The Oysters Rockefeller. the Mac & cheese. filet mignon. everything was just phenomenal. The attention from the staff. the ambiance. just unmatched.,5,5,5,5,August 6 2024
Great food. environment. and most of all service. I‚Äôm kinda torn. cause the food was phenomenal. too. Let‚Äôs call it a tie!!  Highest recommendation!!!,5,5,5,5,August 6 2024
Steak was amazing and the Cesear salad was as well. The staff made our celebration a great memory and was very knowledgeable in recommendations from the menu. I would not recommend the twice baked potato as it was very dry. The mac and cheese was fantastic as well as the vegetable options.,5,3,5,5,August 6 2024
Expensive. but it's like dinner and a show. 2 hr experience that flew by. Sat in Elivis's old booth. All the food was top notch.,5,5,5,5,August 5 2024
We're Vegas locals and have heard of this place for a while.  We finally made it and it did not disappoint!  Everything was delicious. but I was most impressed with the service.  I've been a fan of the Capital Grille for a while.  Been to at least 4 other CG locations nationwide. and have to admit that I like Golden Steer better.  You get more bang for your buck at Golden Steer and honestly. the ambience and service are overall better as well.  I'm a fan. and look forward to coming back.,5,5,5,5,August 5 2024
I have waited 3 years to eat here . Unfortunately reservations were always booked and we finally got to make one . Everything was amazing and the lobster was so delicious ( best lobster I‚Äôve ever had) the history in this restaurant is incredible and the service was amazing and the food was perfectly delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely revisit.,5,5,5,5,August 5 2024
Best steakhouse in Las Vegas!!! Takes you back to when going out for a nice dinner was special. The food and service are on point.,5,5,5,5,August 4 2024
Went last night for our 10 year anniversary. Such an amazing experience if you‚Äôre a food lover. Could sense the history in the building in Vegas. Certainly will go back if reservations are available.,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
Overall. we had a fantastic time. The service was attentive without being overwhelming or annoying. We relaxed and had fun. Our friends from Vegas had not been there in years and loved the experience.,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
Poor serving experience compared to the previous visits. However. food was very good,3,4,2,4,August 3 2024
My husband and I shared the ribeye and lobster tail.  Everything was delicious!  It was our second time there and we'll definitely be back.   Great atmosphere.   Service is first class.,5,5,5,5,August 3 2024
The Golden Steer was good. I don't know why it's so hard to get reservations. it wasn't fantastic. The drinks were good. the caesar salad was meh. French onion soup ok. Now. for our meal they accommodated our group with a plater of lobster. tomahawk ribeye. king crab legs and prime rib. The lobster was dry. the crab was mushy. tomahawk was good and the prime rib was amazing. If I were to back. I'd get the prime rib for sure.,4,4,4,4,August 2 2024
My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and he wanted to take me someplace special. We made this reservation probably 4 months in advance via a waiting list. We arrived about 9pm and our reservation was for 9:15 pm. We waited about 30 minutes after our reservation time had passed before we were seated. Once seated. our waiter wasn‚Äôt great with answering questions and kinda just walked away‚Ä¶ it took a bit for him to come back and take our order. We started with the table side Cesar salad.. it was very good..actually the best part of the meal and it was fun watching it being made.  Next we got the seafood tower. it‚Äôs listed as an appetizer and the presentation was very cool. but flavor wise.. it was pretty awful. The king crab was extremely salty. king crab is suppose to have a light sweetness to it.. the Maine lobster was also salty and tough.. oysters were good. but very small and the shrimp were very large and tasted good. Next we got the 24oz ribeye. I was excited for this.. since it was their specialty and I love a good prime ribeye.  It was flavorless and tough. I couldn‚Äôt even swallow two of the three small bites I had. My husband just had a look of disappointment on his face. I told him it‚Äôs not good and he was relieved I said it first. For a restaurant that prides themselves on their steaks. they should feel ashamed. That was not prime grade. No marbling. no taste and tough. we called the waiter over and let them know the steak was awful and they offered to replace it with another ribeye or another cut. We decided to try the filet mignon. The filet did not redeem them in the slightest. It was dry. also flavorless and not prime. I know what prime tastes like and there is no chance those were prime quality steaks. The whole experience was so disappointing that we didn‚Äôt bother with doing the desert. I was looking forward to the cherry jubilee.. but after such a bad dinner. we could‚Äôve bring ourselves to have another disappointment.,1,1,2,2,August 2 2024
Absolutely the best steakhouse experience ever! Food. wait staff. ambience. everything was top notch! Definitely coming back on our next trip!,5,5,5,5,August 2 2024
We were 8 mins late or the reservation I made months before and the first thing the man at the desk said - we will ‚Äútry to work you into the rotation‚Äù. What does that even mean? Did you give away our table? You don‚Äôt take walk-ins. We made the reservation months ago. What rotation? We were seated a few Minutes later. But not a great welcome. Service after that was EXCELLENT. Our waiters were great. The food was good. It was what I would expect at a steakhouse. My husband said his ribeye was good. Not the best ever. My prime rib was just good- like average good. A little tough actually. Not seasoned at all. I don‚Äôt use salt and I was salting the hell out of it. The shrimp cocktail was average. Large shrimp again not super flavorful. The escargot was delicious and was the best part of the meal. This was NOT the meal I was expecting based on the reviews and prices. I would not return or recommend this restaurant.,4,3,5,4,August 2 2024
It‚Äôs a beautiful room. The food. and the service. were fantastic!,5,5,5,5,August 2 2024
O my God the best lobster ever and the cherries jubilee shoot me I‚Äôm done perfect perfection,4,5,5,5,August 1 2024
Best place we‚Äôve ever eaten. All around great experience,5,5,5,5,August 1 2024
1st time here and it started great ! Amazing place and wonderful people to dine with. All was good until we ordered a wine bottle. We was asked if we wanted it on ice and agreed. Half way through our meal. an employee walked by and poured wine from (who knows where) out of a small glass he held. At the end of our meal. we asked where our wine bottle was and he stated the they gave us a complimentary glass for the occasion and it was the equivalence of what was left on the bottle. Keep in mind. we had only had wine poured from the bottle once.  To make a long story some what short. we had to speak with the manager because we were told that we could not finish our bottle because of what they poured from the anonymous glass.  This didn‚Äôt make sense because when you purchase a bottle. you finish it.  Lastly. we were told that in order to use our military discount. at least 3 people had to have ID‚Äôs. We were a party of 5 with a 5 year old. We are a military family and everyone has a military ID. I never heard that there is a certain number of individuals that has to possess an ID to receive their military discount. But we complied and that was that.  In conclusion. this was our 20 year anniversary and at the end of the day. we had never been treated so poorly in all of Vegas until last night. We may not dine there again in the future. but rather spend our money at places like Oscar‚Äôs or Gordon. or simply Texas Roadhouse to prevent unnecessary delays if we want top tier service and honestly.  Overall. still a beautiful place to dine with amazing history.,3,4,3,4,August 1 2024
Such wonderful customer service! Enjoyed the bananas foster!,5,5,5,5,July 31 2024
Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Will be back many more times.,5,5,5,5,July 31 2024
Food great like always.  Slightly disappointed in changes to the cocktail menu since last time.,5,5,4,5,July 31 2024
Had a group of 5.  Highly recommend the table side ceasar salad. not just for the outstanding flavor but for the experience/show. Group shared the creamed corn. sherry mushrooms and brocolli.  The cream corn was excellent with a little special side taste I wont spoil here. but highly recommend.  Sherry mushrooms were tasty. slightly sweet and paired well with the steak.   Group also shared the bone marrow and if you have never had it. you need to try!  Finally. had a mix of the filet's and ribeye steaks.  Everyone enjoyed theirs. all cooked perfectly.  For desert. had the banana's foster and tiramisu.  The table side presentation for the banana's foster was a good show and the taste was amazing.  Definitely can share the orders or split for two and still be enough.,5,5,5,5,July 31 2024
Classic and exceeded expectations. Great dinner for our party of four,5,5,5,5,July 31 2024
Food is over priced and small portions. Would not come back.,1,2,4,5,July 30 2024
Great steak. service. and ambience!  Made for a great 60 th Birthday dinner celebration!,5,5,5,5,July 30 2024
It was old school. service incredible. drinks spot on and steak melted in my mouth. A Vegas must.,5,5,5,5,July 30 2024
Once we flagged down the waiter to order dinner. the rest of the night went well. People who came in after us. had their order taken first. Food was great!,5,5,4,5,July 30 2024
Making these reservations 5 months ago and the anticipation for this was a total letdown! There are plenty of great steak houses in Las Vegas and lobster as well and much cheaper than this. The place isn‚Äôt worth it to me to be honest! My bone-in ribeye was thin and over cooked.  The lobster was good with the butter.  Bread is ok and the Cesar salad was good but wasn‚Äôt made tableside as we thought we were getting!! So I‚Äôm Good not going back again! My money is good anywhere! Feels to scripted as well! Not genuine feeling at all!! You can say what ever you want.  At the end of the day I can and will out cook anything you can put on the table.  It was a total let down. I‚Äôve seen other reviews.  For that kind of money I should be talking about the experience for months to come like many other fine dining restaurants we go to in Vegas.,2,2,1,2,July 30 2024
This place is amazing! You really can‚Äôt visit Vegas without going to Golden steer. 5 stars all the way!,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
This was our second time at the Golden Steer. our first time was last year around this time. The first time we went we had a fabulous time. The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly and attentive‚Äî we ordered the dinner for two with steak and lobster. I raved about how it was the best steak I‚Äôd ever had to my family and even bought my dad a giftcard for Christmas last year.  Yesterday we returned for my husband‚Äôs 40th birthday. I had worked for months to get this reservation and he was so thrilled when I told him I‚Äôd snagged one! We decided to order the same dish this time since it was such a hit last time. The ceasar salad. prepared table side was just as good as we remembered  Unfortunately the main course was quite underwhelming. The steak was prepared slightly more rare than preferred and lacked seasoning. It was completely bland. The lobster was huge. but very chewy and not served very hot. The butter served with it was also not hot. We were so underwhelmed by the dish. and just kept thinking we should have gone somewhere else.  I know sometimes restaurants have off nights. this night in particular there was a large party in a private room. and the staff was overall frantic all night. But. when guests work hard to get a reservation. and are paying $300+ for a meal. it definitely needs to have quality every time. It was so bad. we now are contemplating if we will ever return. I wish I hadn‚Äôt recommended this to my dad. I hope he has a better experience. One thing I‚Äôll note is that we overheard the folks at the table next to us and they too were unhappy with their steak. They picked at the meal & took it to go. I bet they spent over $400 for an unpleasant experience.  Lastly. the other thing that was strange was the fact that their credit card machines weren‚Äôt working. so they had us leave our zip codes written on the receipt. and the tip amount as they stood looking over us. Overall just unprofessional and weird. We couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there,2,2,3,4,July 29 2024
Service was impeccable. Food was delicious. Excellent!,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
Golden Steer did not disappoint. Definitely worth the three month wait,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
Food was great. Service not in line with the reputation of the restaurant. Overhyped place.,4,5,3,4,July 29 2024
If you can be in the proper dining room it has character that is worthy of the bill.   That doesn‚Äôt mean it is a bad experience - it just means instead of 5 star review for atmosphere. it gets a 4 because we were in the newer room with less ambiance,4,5,5,4,July 29 2024
By far the best restaurant we have ever been too - this is a MUST!,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
We got on the wait list months ago. Was worth the effort and the wait. All agreed out daughter had the best filet we have ever tasted. As for the rest. we think one of the top 5 we have been to in the US which includes Peter Lugers and Killen‚Äôs. Definitely best in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
We have been to Las Vegas many times and have heard about the Golden Steer. but this time we decided to go.  The food was amazing. Appetizer (Calamari) was cooked perfect. Then the Filets were seasoned just right and were cooked to temperature. The Potato was HUGE and cooked fantastic.  The to to it off we had the table side Banana's Foster and you couldn't ask for a better ending.  We sat in Joe DiMaggio's booth. and the old charm of the restaurant really came out. We couldn't have asked for a better meal and ambiance.  I look forward to going again on one of our next visits.,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
This is the place you want to go. Service is the first class. Food is amazing. A little dark in the room. took me a little while for my eyes to adjust. but it may be just me getting old. Very accommodating. Ordered the 40oz tomahawk for the two of us and we couldn‚Äôt even finish it.,5,5,5,5,July 29 2024
Well most of the reviews for the Golden Steer are pretty on point.   Classic Vegas it is. a time warp back to Vegas in the 60s.70s.   Ive lived here for 15 years. finally broke down and waited the 4 months to get it on a date and time we wanted.  Here is my opinion. from a person who has been all over town. all the best and worst places in Las Vegas.   First off every single person that we came in contact with at the restaurant was pleasant and competent at their jobs.   The number of employees is amazing. however you understand how that is when the check comes.  Had a couple of the famous must haves at GS. the tableside Caesar and the Cherries Jubilee.  Shorthorn Steak. Filet Mignon Lobster tail and Crag legs.   Steak was very very nice. all three of us commented on how great the flavor of the steak was. the two med rare steaks were quite bloody but super flavorful.   I think the Shorthorn NY was actually the best piece of meat and most flavorful.   Crab legs were a bit skimpy. I mean three smallish cut in 1/2 pieces and actually served Room temp at best. didn't even seem like heated up. $160 hmmm.   On the other hand the Size of the lobster tail was unreal. HUGE.   But $200 for Steak and Lobster seems a bit over the top.   Nothing else was ordered but Garlic Bread which was ehhh and the peppercorn sauce which was very nice.     Was this a $750 dinner????   In my opinion NO. the ambience is nice and the service nice but $250 a head with the Crab being skimpy and cold on two of the plates probably put this is the No category.  I dont thing I will recommend to others in town.,4,4,5,4,July 29 2024
Our server ordered for us and it was perfect ! Tomahawk steak 2 huge lobster tails and pounds of King Crab legs. Fantastic!! It has been a while since i had simple perfection.  Great Meal Golden Steee,4,5,5,3,July 28 2024
Started off rocky. but they made up for it 10x. 10/10 would def do it again.,5,5,5,5,July 28 2024
Overall disappointing. I booked this 5 months ago indicating it was a special occasion for my 60th birthday for 5 people. I had a private room celebration there in DeDecember and loved everything about it. This time we arrived and they put my party in the kids room right next to a dehumidifier. It was loud and someone from our party asked if they could turn it down or off. They said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. I then asked to be moved which they did to another room with 3 tables in it. We sat at a table for 10? With 5 people. I thought at least we‚Äôd be in or in the proximity of the main dining room considering the early booking. previous visit and occasion. Listen food was great. waiter was less than enthusiastic and atmosphere was awful. Disappointment considering everything to include the food quality there are much better options. They did not make this night special. Thank god my family did. Careful not to rest on your laurels.,3,5,3,1,July 28 2024
Absolutely amazing. worth the wait for a reservation! Got to sit in Sammy Davis. Jr‚Äôs booth to enjoy a piece of history!,5,5,5,5,July 28 2024
Great place and food. Pretty loud overall due to acoustics in room.,5,5,5,5,July 27 2024
Best night ever. the salad. steak. and mushrooms were all amazing. We will go back!,5,5,5,5,July 27 2024
Wonderful service and good: we had the steak and liver for two and the Caesar salad.  It was my husband‚Äôs birthday and they brought him a slice of cheesecake !,5,5,5,5,July 26 2024
Absolutely amazing. Bone marrow starter is beyond anything I‚Äôve had anywhere else. Steak and lobster cooked and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,July 26 2024
Classic steakhouse style and mystique outdone only by the amazing quality of the food and service! A must to include in your Vegas experience! Thank you Golden Steer. we‚Äôll be back!!!,5,5,5,5,July 26 2024
All staff are super friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and very well prepared.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
Being able to share a piece of history with amazing food was the perfect start to our vacation.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
What a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the best of Las Vegas.  Service and quality of the highest level.  Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the whole experience.  I definitely recommend it to those wanting to capture a piece of old Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
The food and service was outstanding. Will definitely return.,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
I have wanted to dine here for a while and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Service was excellent. food was phenomenal!! My wife and I shared a 24 oz Porterhouse and shared a massive baked potato. The wedge salad was crisp and delicious. Tiramisu for dessert was the topper!! I will be back !!!!,5,5,5,5,July 25 2024
Our favorite special occasion restaurant. Love the old school Vegas feel.,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
This was a perfect the first experience we were looking for. We ordered a little bit of everything the crab legs and lobster tail were absolutely amazing. Ribeyes perfectly cooked. Definitely on my list now everytime i come to town! The history behind the building they talk about is very neat too! 10/10,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
Great place for food and restaurant history‚Ä¶ A Vegas staple,5,4,5,5,July 24 2024
Booths are to tight for any man over 300.  ÔøºWaiter confused my order and over charged.  Good food. tight seats. over price. nice ambiance,4,4,5,5,July 24 2024
Excellent choice for dinner. The four of us ordered family style the 24oz rib eye. lobster tail and crab legs. All were delicious. We started with the table side Caesar salad and ended with the table side bananas foster. Everything was amazing! The staff was attentive and helpful and made the experience a five star night!,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
fantastic meal.. 4 th visit. will be back again..can't recommend enough,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
Absolutely delicious!  After reading about the history plus the sound of Frank Sinatra singing plus plus delicious food. I cannot wait to come back!,5,5,5,5,July 24 2024
Hands down best dinner ever! Worth every penny spent.,5,5,5,5,July 23 2024
Absolutely outstanding! The prime rib. the shorthorn. and filet mignon were all fabulous! We didn‚Äôt order appetizers just because we really wanted to enjoy the steak. and we certainly did. We did. however. order a few sauces. the garlic butter and cream brandy  and bearnaise. delicious! It‚Äôs pricey. but worth every penny! Enjoy,5,5,5,5,July 23 2024
Amazing experience. Delicious food. amazing service and fun vintage Vegas atmosphere! We will be back for sure! Love it so much! Just not a great location‚Ä¶ but it will not stop us from going back!,5,5,5,5,July 23 2024
First time dining here. Name and reputation speaks for itself and did not disappoint. Wife and I ordered the Longhorn and Lobster for two. Overall expensive meal. but I cannot lie. it was delicious. I don‚Äôt know if I will comeback due to the cost unless we have something to celebrate. but we are glad we ate there. David was our server and he was professional and made it a great experience. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,5,5,5,July 23 2024
The service was absolutely amazing. Our food was delicious and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back. Only slight negative was the noise level and children crying. but that is not the Golden Steers fault.,5,5,5,4,July 23 2024
This is the go to steakhouse in Vegas. Service. ambiance. and food is on point and a decent value for a Vegas steakhouse. Most portions are massive and taste excellent.,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
The food and service were top notch! We had a party of 5 and the servers were impeccable!,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Well worth the stalking! Lol!!!! So glad we got a reservation and were able to experience this place! üôå From the service to the food. everything was amazing. Even being a 945 reservation. did not feel rushed (although internally I was stressing. lol). There was a wait seating us. so we just grabbed a cocktail at the bar & they even had machines to do a lil gambling while we waited (lost). üòâ We did not catch the attire notice before we packed and flew to Vegas - so we were super nervous (went in the hottest summer time ever. so only had sandals) ... but they still let us in & gave the some booties to wear. Thank you so much. That really made our evening!!!!!!! ‚ú®Ô∏è,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Great great food and service. Giant lobster tail.,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Wonderful food and excellent service overall. Our main server was a little rude after we didn‚Äôt order as much food as he wanted for a table for three (2 entrees and 3 caesar salads) but we ordered cocktails. too. Hopefully. we won‚Äôt be treated poorly next time.,4,5,4,5,July 22 2024
Absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish. Went on a double date and shared a family style meal with a 57 ounce tomahawk. Caesar salads. lobster. and broccoli. Everything was impeccable: the service. atmosphere. food. everything.,5,5,5,5,July 22 2024
Attentive. diligent waiters who made us feel welcome. The food was good but salty; I realize people have different palates but this restaurant had the most consistently salty food of any restaurant I‚Äôve visited. Good experience overall. but not sure I would return.,3,3,5,4,July 22 2024
We had a great dining experience. celebrating our  Anniversary with our family.  We were provided the best customer service from the moment we entered the door.  Justin. our lead waiter. went over the menu with us and made suggestions that we appreciated.  We shared the tomahawk steak and lobster and they were both prepared well.  Caesar salad and bananas foster are a must- enjoy the show! Can‚Äôt wait to come back and try other items on the menu.,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
A must-try experience if you can get in. The service was second to none. and it definitely had an old-school Vegas vibe. I went on a guys' trip and while I may be spoiled with steak houses in my hometown. I'd say the price point is a bit high for the food quality. However. I would definitely recommend it!,5,3,5,5,July 21 2024
It took a while to get our drinks. Our appetizer came out before our drinks. Waiter had to keep checking on status of drinks,4,5,3,5,July 21 2024
My birthday party of 6 was seated at the Elvis booth. The customer service was impeccable from beginning to end. Thank you Chris and Tommy! Food and drinks were AMAZING!,5,5,5,5,July 21 2024
Great to get reservations to a classic place that has been around forever,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
The bone-in ribeye was really good. we really recommend the lobster tails,5,5,5,4,July 20 2024
We were planning our wedding anniversary trip and this was the only thing my husband really wanted to do. I tried for months to get a reservation and was so excited when we got it the day before our trip. Everything was amazing the ambiance. service. food etc. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We will definitely be visiting again. Thank you for making our experience so amazing!,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
We‚Äôve had Golden Steer on our Vegas bucket list for several years and finally scored a reservation. We were immensely disappointed when upon arrival they tried to see us in a small dining room away from the main restaurant with absolutely zero atmosphere. Fortunately. they had availability to move us into the main dining room where there was so much more energy (and people)! So my pro tip is to ask to be seated in a booth in the main dining room when you make a reservation. Overall. the food was good. but it didn‚Äôt blow me away. Overall. it was a good experience and I would go back.,4,4,5,4,July 20 2024
Best service we have ever had against some pretty stiff competition in Las Vegas. Large number of very attentive servers and staff. Outstanding appetizers - we shared everything and  couldn't decide which was best. all outstanding. Filets mignon took our breath away. Food going to other tables also looked great. Hell of a martini.  Energetic atmosphere and full tables made long distance conversation challenging. Not sure we would bring young kids. Would recommend for a high end crowd and would definitely go again.,5,5,5,5,July 20 2024
Staff was nice. food was great overall. don‚Äôt recommend the side dish broccoli.,5,4,5,5,July 20 2024
We really enjoyed eating at The Golden Steer. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We enjoyed the table side Caesar salad and the history the server shared with us while he made it. We will definitely go there again.,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
Food was outstanding. well worth the wait. Made reservations 4 months before attending.  We had Shrimp De Jonge. Oyster Rockefeller. bone marrow.  sea-bass.  bone in ribeye and bananas foster.  All were wonderful!,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
Absolutely delish place!!   Get the Caesar salad & a steak & bananas foster‚Äîfor sureüôåüèªüôåüèª. Great service‚Äîas well!!,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
Overall. we were left slightly disappointed. Although the steak was good. the lobster was really over cooked. which is a similar opinion to other posts have seen.  Was expecting more.,2,2,4,4,July 19 2024
Everything was excellent. Could feel the history and the old school vibe. Felt like the rat pack could walk in any minute. Our servers Ali and Cory were phenomenal. Book it and go. I had prime rib with shrimp de jonghe and my wife had filet and crab legs. App was meatballs and garlic bread. Everything was on point. Find the time to go. This is Vegas.,5,5,5,5,July 19 2024
Food was subpar King Crab 40 $ each yikes Not good ..porterhouse looked like choice meat at best. sides were so small and tasteless Desert average Service well moving on Dress Code right Will never go back !!!!!! TOURIST TRAP Locals would never repeat,1,1,1,1,July 19 2024
Golden Steer proved to be an excellent choice for dinner!  Our meals were prepared to perfection and the service was impeccable‚Ä¶all culminating in a memorable dining experience. We began with their world famous Caesar Salad prepared table side.  The steaks were so buttery and almost fork tender.   The HUGE 10oz Australian Lobster Tails were sweet and flavorful!  And‚Ä¶the King Crab Legs. melted in my mouth!  The sides were delicious‚Ä¶I must say. the loaded baked potato was the largest ever! We topped off our dinner with Bananas Foster prepared table side as well.  If you haven‚Äôt already eaten at Golden Steer. it‚Äôs a MUST when in Vegas.  Caution‚Ä¶ be sure to secure a reservation at least 3 months in advance!!!  It‚Äôs so worth it!!!,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Great food!  Great atmosphere!  All professionals!,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Excellent food - Ribeye. Filet Mignon. Caesar Salad  Excellent Service Team,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
We love your food. everything is excellent except the calamare. Our family loves calamare. We notice that it was bland. there is no taste and texture was not crunchy. But overall. everything are so delicious and meat is tender. I will still recommend Golden Steer to our friends.,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
Great food and ambience. very pricy as no sides are included in the price. I had filet mignon cooked to perfection with butter.  The butter topping was delicious and helped elevate the seasoning of the meat.  Also has the wedge salad.  Super great blue cheese dressing.  Overall would recommend but be prepared to fork over $100 per person.,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
We enjoyed our evening so much! If I could have licked the plates respectfully I would have‚Ä¶. üòÇ! Wonderful staff and friendly! A lot of Delicious food!,5,5,5,5,July 18 2024
We had their famous Caesar salad. and it lives up to the hype.  We each ordered entrees. mine was a delectable prime rib cooked to perfection.  Our table agreed on three sides. whipped potatoes. garlic/parmesan broccoli. and cream corn.  Due to a birthday. they helped us celebrate with a luxurious slice of cheesecake.  The service was top-notch.  This landmark establishment easily lives up to its renowned reputation.,5,5,5,5,July 17 2024
We absolutely loved dining here. The service. the food - literally everything was great. Go here you won‚Äôt be disappointed.,5,5,5,5,July 17 2024
Everything was great except the parking. would be great if they could expand it,5,5,5,5,July 17 2024
Caesar salad was just ok. Romaine lettuce was not cold. and was yellow.  Steak was very fatty.  Would not go again:,3,2,3,4,July 17 2024
Had to reserve three months in advance. but worth the wait. Food was delicious. Service was impeccable. A bit pricey.  But I would go again. this time reserving a booth. A lot of traffic around the tables.,5,5,5,4,July 17 2024
The food was decent but my lobster tail was overcooked.  Drinks were the best part. I ordered 2 cocktails. I‚Äôve always wanted to try thjs place because it gets amazing reviews. I am local and reservations are booked months in advance so that‚Äôs the downfall. but I found It to be similar to Herbs N Rye or Cleaver but overall it was a good experience. a lot of food.,4,3,4,5,July 17 2024
Great experience.  My husband and I split the Porterhouse. My picture will probably not do it justice. but it was cooked medium and sliced plated.   The meat was succulent. and its juices were tangy with a hint of pepper. For the sides. my husband had the twice baked potato. which was hearty. I enjoyed the creamed spinach. which was creamy buttery.,5,5,4,5,July 17 2024
Our experience was perfect! We loved the service. food. and vintage ambience. Will def be back!,5,5,5,5,July 16 2024
Best birthday dinner. Restaurant gives old Hollywood glamour! Staff was courteous and knowledgeable. We loved the table side Cesar salad and banana flamb√©. Both were delicious. We couldn‚Äôt stop eating the banana flamb√© and vanilla ice cream. The lobster tail was huge and tender. They give generous food portions so that you‚Äôre able to share and try a little of everything. Overall a wonderful experience.,5,5,5,5,July 15 2024
A little expensive. 10-15% I would estimate but excellent food and service.  Higher cost can be justified but does limit how often I go.,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
Perfect blend of tradition without stuffiness. Delicious apps. tableside Caesar. and Filets. Seasoned staff and vintage decor made for a classic experience.,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
Parking is a nightmare. Nothing short of. People traveling the wrong way down the single aisle. tow signs in places they shouldn‚Äôt be. Whatever. As a local. I can say I‚Äôve been but won‚Äôt be back.  Service was great - no complaints there. This place may have been fine size wise in 1958 and for a few decades to follow. but in 2024 it‚Äôs ridiculously small. The booths are nice but extremely small whatever tables they have are taken with huge crowds. Which explains the limited availability when booking a reservation‚Ä¶that I made in November 2023 for last night!!  All that aside. the steaks were on point and everything was cooked as asked. I found the sides lacking: mac & cheese was bland. whipped potatoes flavorless & twice baked potato while quite good. overly salty. The bananas foster prepared tableside was exciting to watch and really good.  For $517 for 3 (one of our meals was the tomahawk) it wasn‚Äôt unreasonable again. as the steaks were well done. However I‚Äôve had better meals that were just as good if not better at both Hanks & Echo & Rig and never had to fight for parking.,5,4,4,4,July 14 2024
You come here for the history and the vibes. You come back for the food and impeccable service.,5,5,5,5,July 14 2024
As 4th generation natives of Las Vegas we were so excited to finally get a reservation after 6 months. The service was terrible. Working for Luxury hotel companies I know what service is and I‚Äôve  never been so rushed to eat my dinner. The food was sub par. Way overpriced!!! Better meal and service at Barry‚Äôs. TBOnes. and SW steakhouse. As a local and native I won‚Äôt be able to refer anyone to Golden Steer again as I have in the past. knowing how iconic it is to our city.What a disappointment.,2,2,1,5,July 13 2024
The service was impeccable. Very doting and explained the menu. Our food was outstanding. we just ordered too much of it!,5,5,5,5,July 13 2024
One of a kind dining experiences! Service & food was phenomenal!,5,5,5,5,July 12 2024
A place you have to try at least once. But you‚Äôll keep coming back.,5,5,5,5,July 12 2024
The atmosphere was my absolute favorite. The waiters were very attentive and had such great stories to tell. My favorite was definitely the lobster!,4,4,5,5,July 12 2024
Our device was exceptional! James was very understanding and attentive!,5,5,5,5,July 12 2024
Great food. great service. Best steak I‚Äôve ever had,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
Seriously this has been the BEST meal I have ever had. We really wanted to eat here as a honeymoon celebration and after many attempts. we were lucky enough to get a reservation. From the drinks. to salad. to crab legs. steaks. sides. and dessert everything was truly phenomenal. The service was amazing and everyone was extremely hospitable and welcoming. I highly recommend dining here if you are able to. You will not be disappointed with anything you order. I highly recommend the crab legs and tomahawk meal. We will definitely be coming back the next time we visit Vegas!,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
Amazing dinner and service! Thank you. we‚Äôll be back!,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
The steak and lobster meal for 2 was unbelievable.  The Cesaer salad was also delicious.  Will be going back on next trip to Vegas,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
From the moment we got there we had excellent service and interactions with the staff. Food was excellent and I will definitely be returning. Steak lobster lamb chicken parmesan calamari salad banana Foster shrimp cocktail all absolutely stunning.,5,5,5,5,July 11 2024
We have traveled to Vegas several times. Eating at The Golden Steer Steakhouse is a must first thing we reserve when we come. The staff is fantastic. the food is delicious. and the ambiance is outstanding. I‚Äôve tried several different items on the menu and they all were amazing.  Words cannot express how delicious it is.,5,5,5,5,July 10 2024
Unfortunately the lobster tail was tough and not great tasting.  prime rib was flavorless and bland. Mushrooms were great. drinks were outstanding.,3,2,5,5,July 10 2024
First time visiting will be returning!! Excellent service. food was amazing nice old school environment,5,5,5,4,July 10 2024
Wow We booked months before to get a table and was worried that it might not live up to the reviews But was hands down the best dinner we had this trip The food . service and the ambiance where great,5,5,5,5,July 9 2024
We started off with the Caesar salad for two which I was really looking forward to. but we both felt they put way too much dressing on the salad and it was way overpowering. took away from the rest of our meal. We followed that up with two baked potatoes. My wife had the lobster for an entr√©e which she said was excellent and I had the ribeye and that was excellent as well. Overall experience given the history of the restaurant I would‚Äôve given it at five. but I have to takeoff some because of of the salad just being overpowering. that took away from the rest of the meal. If I went back. I would definitely tell them to put a lot less dressing on the salad.,4,4,5,4,July 9 2024
Very impressed... no matter how long it takes to get a reservation we will be returning  .,5,5,5,5,July 9 2024
The French onion soup was one of the best we had. Both the strip steak and the 9oz filet were hard to chew. For the price they should have been more of a tender chew. I‚Äôd go back for the soup but not the steak. I felt I didn‚Äôt get what I paid for.,4,3,5,4,July 8 2024
As good a steak as you will find anywhere and the service is first class,5,5,5,5,July 8 2024
This was a 10 out 10 experience. i surprised my wife for her Birthday and was not dissapointed . must try the Tomohawk Steak and the Ceasar Salad !  Thank you !!!!,5,5,5,5,July 7 2024
Had an amazing experience. Me and my girlfriend loved it.,5,5,5,5,July 7 2024
The food was AMAZING! I came here for my anniversary and they did not disappoint. They gave us a complimentary champagne toast that made our experience that much more special. The lobster was tender and sweet. The steak was flavorful and tender. I would absolutely come back to GoldenSteer.,5,5,5,5,July 7 2024
Food was amazing. extremely pricey. but everything was fantastic. Including the service wow. mind blown.,5,5,5,5,July 6 2024
The tomahawk is delicious. So was everything else. And it was at a reasonable price. The service was top notch. We had multiple servers who handled different aspects of our meal and checked in on us frequent enough without being intrusive. Looking forward to my next visit.,5,5,5,5,July 6 2024
Best steakhouse I‚Äôve ever been to. The service was incredible. I will without a doubt return next time I come to Vegas!,5,5,5,5,July 6 2024
came in from San Francisco for our anniversary to eat here did not disappoint   Definitely coming back,5,5,5,5,July 6 2024
Waited a long time ‚Ä¶.and it was well worth ! Everything on point !,5,5,5,5,July 6 2024
Table side caesar is a must. Great over all experience!,5,5,5,5,July 6 2024
Excellent service. food. everything! My Yelp review provides pictures &. More in depth review.,5,5,5,5,July 5 2024
Excellent as usual! Best steakhouse in Las Vegas!!!,5,5,4,5,July 5 2024
A vintage dining experience with great food and an exceptional staff. Fantastic!,5,5,5,5,July 5 2024
Outstanding service. food and ambience. We will return next time we visit Vegas! The best meal in Vegas is here!,5,5,5,5,July 5 2024
Incredible in all aspects!  Steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The king crab was off the charts.  üòé‚ù§Ô∏è,5,5,5,5,July 5 2024
Excellent service. outstanding food. lovely ambiance.,5,5,5,5,July 5 2024
This is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. The staff was anazing and very helpful. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was great. I would definitely dine here again.,5,5,5,5,July 5 2024
We make a reservation every time we come to Vegas. It is always a great meal. The staff is very attentive.,5,5,5,5,July 4 2024
In Las Vegas for my birthday - In the top 5 meals I've ever had - Impeccable service. attentive knowledgeable staff. well cooked incredible food. definitely will be back for another trip to try the bone marrow!  (Only thing that could have been better would be if we had a booth but it was PACKED),5,5,5,4,July 4 2024
Atmosphere was good.  Waiters were pretty good.  Lettuce was limp and brown.  Broccoli was awful.  Steak was good.  Cream corn was fantastic.  Garlic bread was ok.  Meatballs were good.  At the price point of $700 for 3 people. everything that comes out of that kitchen has to be excellent.   That wasn‚Äôt the case.  Oscars was far better and less expensive.,3,3,4,5,July 4 2024
Ordered the diner for two. longhorn steak and lobster and it fed three of us. the steak was perfect and the lobster was the best I have ever had. desert was banana foster!! It was amazing,5,5,5,5,July 4 2024
Biggest lobster tail Iv ever had! Amazing drinks. wonderful service!,5,5,5,5,July 4 2024
Great dinner and service with all requests being met and exceeded. I would love to go back.,5,5,5,5,July 3 2024
My son and I had dinner there last night and we ordered the Filet/Lobster tail and NY Strip/Lobster tail...both game with a side salad ( wedge/bacon ) and sides and we got the stuffed baked potato and whipped mashed potato.  Cost for those 2 items were $200 and $207  We couldn't finish our meal as it was enormous portions. didn't really touch our sides.  Ordered Cherries Jubilee and it was amazing.  For 2 people. I suggest ordering the Tomahawk or NY Strip/Lobster tail  Cost was $255 and $250  Service was IMPECCABLE!!!  GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR SURE!!!,5,5,5,5,July 3 2024
The steak and lobster were amazing! Twice baked potato was a bit overdone for my taste. but still delicious. Table-made Caesar is a must. We also had the grilled asparagus and some bernaise sauce. I wish I would‚Äôve had room for dessert but just couldn‚Äôt do it. Would definitely recommend this place. It had a very elegant. vintage Vegas vibe.,4,4,4,4,July 3 2024
This was our first time here and it was an absolutely amazing. awesome experience! Spencer. our waiter was very friendly and helpful! He made the experience even better for us! Every single person who worked there was very friendly. Atmosphere was something to remember. We made reservations back in the winter and I‚Äôm so happy that we kept it! My filet and crab was delicious. perfectly cooked! I‚Äôd recommend the table side Caesar Salad. it is by far the BEST I‚Äôve ever had! My boyfriend had the Ribeye and Lobster tail and it was just as delicious as we hoped it would be! We will definitely be back again someday! We will also tell everyone we know how amazing our experience was! Thank you!,5,5,5,5,July 3 2024
Food and service was fantastic and price was right inline with similar restaurants with lower quality food. Our only issue was the way our table was.  There was six of us and two of us could not hear the rest of us. We were sat in an L shape. Next time and we will go again I will ask for a different table.,5,5,5,5,July 3 2024
Ribeye is delicious. table side anything is amazing but the bananas foster was My favorite.,5,5,5,4,July 2 2024
Our first experience here. but will certainly be back. The drinks were exquisite. The service was exceptional. Truly the iconic Vegas vibe. I cannot recommend it enough.,5,5,5,5,July 2 2024
Best of the best. Amazing place to go service is superior.,5,5,5,5,July 2 2024
We had our anniversary dinner here and they went above and beyond to make our evening special.  The service was top notch. the food was delish. and the overall experience was a 10 out of 10.  Is it the best steak in Las Vegas!?  Maybe not but it‚Äôs the most iconic and definitely worth the trip.,5,5,5,5,July 2 2024
Amazing food. service. and restaurant. We enjoyed ourselves celebrating our loved one üòä,5,5,5,5,July 2 2024
Hands-down. the best service and food we have ever had!,5,5,5,5,July 1 2024
The team taking care of the dinner tables - amazing!,5,5,5,5,July 1 2024
This was incredible!  The food and service were outstanding.  We were lucky enough to get a booth which really added to the ambience.  The Caesar salad preparation at the table was another lovely touch and which made the experience all the more enjoyable.  Two very happy diners. thank you Golden Steer. we‚Äôll definitely be backüòä.  Highly recommended!,5,5,5,5,July 1 2024
"This was our second trip to this wonderful steakhouse in less than one year.  The first trip was definitely better. It was a very busy evening and we had a party of eight persons.  One of the steaks ordered was overcooked and had to be redone while the rest of the table ate their food.  This was not comped. and should have been. Other steaks were not cooked to specifications but we made due. however. the lobster tails were phenomenal. HUGE. and delicious! For our birthday celebration and to ""make up for"" the improperly cooked steak. they did comp us two dishes of the cherries jubilee for the entire table of eight to share.  Very expensive and the wine was very overpriced - a $41 retail bottle was $168 - that's a bit much of a mark up!  It's a great experience to eat here at least once for the ambiance and history.",5,4,4,5,July 1 2024
In general our experience was a good one but a few disappointments surprised us. Shortly after seating us. dinner rolls were delivered to our table and they were small hard and unappetizing. Our next courses. the Escargot and the Caesar Salad were standouts. We ordered the dinner for two with a Longhorn (?) steak and lobster. We ordered the steak medium-rare but it arrived distinctly on the rare side. However although under-done. the meat was very high quality and tender. The lobster tail was large and delicious. The service was excellent as expected. So not a perfect night overall but a very good one.,4,4,5,5,July 1 2024
Nice ambience. the entrees were a little slow coming  out. The food was absolutely delicious. The Caesar salad and creamed corn were the star sides.,5,5,4,5,July 1 2024
Everything was outstanding! Would highly recommend to anyone!,5,5,5,5,July 1 2024
Food and service were both amazing!  We have a toddler and she ate every bite of prime rib we gave her!  We ordered Prime Rib. Ribeye. calamari. Mac and cheese. Parmesan broccoli. and creamed corn.  Everything was so delicious. we finished everything. Reservation tip: I set a few open table notifications for the dates and times I was looking for to help secure a reservation. When the dates got closer I would check open table to see what availability the restaurant had and was actually able to get a couple reservations.  Hope that helps!,5,5,5,5,July 1 2024
Chris our server was amazing. He was very attentive and pleasant.,5,5,5,5,July 1 2024
If only there were more seats! I would gladly recommend this to everyone!,5,5,5,5,June 30 2024
Ôøº The ambience was great. I love the old swanky Vegas feel! My waiter name was Justin and he did not disappoint very professional and very well knowledgeable about the steakhouse and menu.,5,5,5,5,June 29 2024
I can't explain how enjoyable this dinner was for our party of two.  Just go and enjoy the atmosphere and the food.  It is an expensive dinner but oh so good! Don't let the outer appearance fool you.  This is a top-notch experience.,5,5,5,5,June 29 2024
Food and service were phenomenal.   Worth the hype!!,5,5,5,5,June 29 2024
One of our fav spots! Always amazing food & service!,5,5,5,5,June 29 2024
We really enjoyed the table side Caesar salad and the waiter who made it telling us all about the history of the restaurant. The food was delicious!,5,5,5,5,June 29 2024
Little disappointed this visit. still very good but not the same as my last visit. lobster was overpriced and not good . my bad for not sticking with steak. also a lot of people not adhering to dress code,4,4,4,5,June 29 2024
Justin and all the others were very attentive and the food was absolutely amazing üòä,5,5,5,5,June 29 2024
Our go to place for Steaks and giant lobster tails in Vegas‚Ä¶..mine and my buddies tradition for four years now!!!!!!! Amazing!!!!,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
Been going here since the early 90s!!! Don‚Äôt miss out!!!,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
First time there can't wait to go bsck food was very delicious prime rib perfect.,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
This is a must visit when you go to Vegas. Highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
Wonderful staff and atmosphere. Truly made it a night to remember forever.,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
We had such a wonderful experience! And the food was AMAZING!,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
Had a wonderful time celebrating my husband for his birthday! The service. food and environment were incredible. It was a little noisy at times. more so than I would have expected. but it really didn‚Äôt take away from our dining experience.   We tried the escargot. bone marrow and table side salad to start. They couldn‚Äôt have been better. Then we finished with a shorthorn and lobster for two along with the whipped potatoes and mushrooms as our sides. All came highly recommended and did not disappoint.   No doubt we‚Äôll be adding Golden Steer to our regular rotation!,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
My wife and I were very disappointed with our time and meal at the Golden Steer. We had expected so much more. The service was really quite excellent. but the staff knew there were problems as we were apologized to numerous times throughout the evening. The steak was overpriced. $77 for a 16 oz NY strip which was full of grizzle and tough as a boot. The cream corn has so much cinnamon in it (and maybe nutmeg) it was barely edible. The twice baked potatoes were so salty that they were inedible. The salad was mediocre at best especially considering the price. Without asking. the restaurant took off the expense for the potatoes because they came so late in the meal. The highlight. if any. was when the waiter brought cheesecake to the table for my birthday. When the bill came. the restaurant's credit card machine was down and took a long time to get our bill paid. The credit card machine was not necessarily the restaurant's fault; however. we were told they had been having trouble with it for 2 weeks.  Overall. we were looking forward to eating here. but after this experience. neither my wife nor I can recommend a return.  Finally. it was the loudest restaurant I think I've ever been in. We could not carry on a conversation because it was so loud.,2,2,4,2,June 28 2024
First time going to Golden Steer.  Might just be one of the best steaks I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶and lobster was outstanding.  Will definitely put GS as a must-stop next time I‚Äôm in Vegas.  Need to get reservations far. far in advance.  I would‚Äôve gone a second time the week I was there. but no availability.,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
Absolutely amazing.  Well worth the 4 month wait for a reservation.  Ambience. service. food. All top notch.  Caesar salad was out of this world. Tomahawk was top notch.  All sides weee amazing.  Our server even gave us a couple wonderful stories that took place there over the years. one that included Sinatra. Cannot wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
The Service at the Golden Steer was impeccable.  Everyone was friendly and wanted to make sure we had a great time.  The food was delicious!,5,5,5,5,June 28 2024
If you're looking for that vintage Las Vegas vibe. look no further than the Golden Steer.  It feels as if any one of the Rat Pack members could saunter in at any moment.  You will need to book your reservation well in advance due to it's popularity.  Bring your appetite. the food comes in big portions!  Our service was first class. as you would expect in a restaurant of this stature.  An overall great experience.,5,5,5,5,June 27 2024
It was a good steakhouse but I have had better . For the prices that the food was I would have expected better.,4,4,5,5,June 27 2024
Lobster was terrible..the couple we went with had it last time and enjoyed it but didn‚Äôt like this time as well!!!,1,1,4,4,June 27 2024
An amazing place. Would highly recommend and definitely return!,5,5,5,5,June 27 2024
We fell in love with this place about 15 years ago when they still steamed their steaks. At the time the steaks were good. but nothing  compared to the way they are today. My wife and I both got a fillet along with the twice baked potatoes and Parmesan broccoli.  As an appetizer we had their Caesar salad. which is one of my favorite Caesar‚Äôs. We ended both having an espresso martini. which was as amazing as the food. My only complaint is now it is too popular and is very hard to get a reservation (when you could walk in 15 years ago).,5,5,5,5,June 27 2024
The BEST restaurant in Vegas! Service. food. ambiance all 5 star+!!!,5,5,5,5,June 27 2024
Wonderful! Excellent food and service. Ali was fantastic! The filet and lobster was amazing. will be going back again. thank you for a lovely dinner and experience!,5,5,5,5,June 27 2024
Once in a life time experience! We absolutely adored the whole experience. We were so blessed to have Jason give us insight to the rich history of the steakhouse. All the staff were just lovely.  The ambience (we visited weeknight. evening) was so romantic and felt like we stepped back in time to classic Vegas.  The food was just divine! We celebrated our anniversary with the couples dinner. drinks. and the absolute ‚Äúcherry‚Äù on top-cherry jubilee dessert.,5,5,5,5,June 26 2024
Very nice dinner with professional friendly service and quality meal. Real Vegas vibe.,4,4,4,4,June 26 2024
Among the best meals of my life - excellent French onion soup. tableside Caesar salad. filet mignon with garlic butter. and bananas foster. I will absolutely be back.,5,5,5,5,June 26 2024
Everything was great except for the shorthorn we ordered. Service was good at times but would fall off and we wouldn‚Äôt have any one check on us for half hours at a time.,4,2,3,4,June 26 2024
We were so excited to try out the Golden Steer. We explore supper clubs all over. The service was outstanding. Can‚Äôt say enough. The lobster and the table side Caesar salad were so worth it. My husband ordered the prime rib. it had no flavor. Afterwards we heard the ribeye is what they are known for. For the price I will go elsewhere.,4,3,5,5,June 26 2024
Wonderful experience! We had excellent service and the food was delicious.,5,5,5,5,June 26 2024
We enjoyed our first visit to the Golden Steer. Very old Vegas vibes and attentive. friendly staff. We ordered shrimp cocktail. Caesar salad. filet. creamed corn. fries and cocktails. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared.,5,5,5,5,June 26 2024
This place is old school. Tuxedo waiters. leather booths and old memorabilia.  They have classics on the menu. Tableside ceasar salad. sherry cream mushrooms and cherries jubilee. Reservations are hard to come by because of all the publicity this place has gotten.,5,5,5,5,June 26 2024
This restaurant needs to be on everyone's Las Vegas bucket list! It's easily one of the best steakhouses in the world AND has ambience and service that is unrivaled. When you go. there are a few must do's: arrive on time for your reservation. order the tableside Caesar salad. and soak it all in.,5,5,5,5,June 25 2024
My husband and I are in town for International Fight Week and we knew we had to eat at Golden Steer! It took a couple months to snag a reservation but I did it and am so. so glad I did!!  This place is AWESOME! The service is spectacular. the food was so delicious. the ambience is lovely. James and Carlos were our servers and they were great. James was especially awesome.  The table side Cesar salad was so cool and the gentleman who made it for us explained some of the history of Golden Steer; which famous person sat where. where the original areas were. etc. It was the best Cesar salad ever and that‚Äôs my jam. Cesar is my favorite food and I‚Äôve had them all over the place so coming from me that‚Äôs quite a compliment!  We got the bone marrow as an appetizer. yum yum yum!! I ordered the filet Oscar style with a lobster tail and a twice baked potato. My husband ordered the 24oz bone-in ribeye with asparagus. Everything was amazing!! The best meal we‚Äôve ever had at a steakhouse! We already can‚Äôt wait to go back. Any time we‚Äôre in Vegas. you know where we‚Äôll be.  Thank you Golden Steer. James and Carlos!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,5,5,5,June 25 2024
I can see the hype with GSS. It was a decent meal. classic steakhouse ambiance.,4,4,5,5,June 25 2024
Great service. great atmosphere. Everyone was so nice and went the extra mile for my husband‚Äôs birthday.  Food wise. aside from the steak (NY). the food wasn‚Äôt good. Sides were served cold and with very little flavor if any (Mac and cheese. broccoli). Chicken parm had no flavor either. Even the dinner rolls were bland. For the price. definitely would have expected better quality for all the dishes. But they are known for their steaks. and the steak didn‚Äôt miss.  Glad to try it for its history and ambience. but wouldn‚Äôt go again.,3,2,4,5,June 25 2024
Amazing seafood. steaks were out of this world. loved the service. One of the best places we've ever eaten. will definitely stop in if we come back to Vegas,5,5,5,5,June 24 2024
When we arrived the kitchen suffered a power outage which delayed our seating by an hour. During the wait I witnessed multiple confrontations between customers and the hosts. I felt the hosts were more combative versus calming and problem solving.  My guest had a food allergy and we had to return a dish because of it. A host came to our table to check on the overall situation but again I felt that there was a slight confrontational energy that wasn‚Äôt necessary.  The returned dish was taken off our bill though we would have paid for it so my issue is more pointing out that the hosts were combative and confrontational more than anything.  I will say the Caesar Salad was by far the best I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I had the 18oz Prime Rib and it was prepared to perfection as was my baked potato.  Also the bar prepared a perfect Old Fashioned with Bullit Bourbon.,4,5,3,5,June 23 2024
I love the place. the ambience was awesome.  The staff was amaizing and very helpful with one of us with ADA accomodation.,5,4,5,5,June 23 2024
Best steak and lobster restaurant Iv ever eaten in,5,5,5,5,June 22 2024
The food and service was amazing.  Wine was great too.,5,5,5,5,June 21 2024
Awesome spot!! They play it safe with seasoning but it was truly fantastic:),5,5,5,5,June 21 2024
Golden steer is arguably the best overall restaurant in Vegas with amazing food. service and ambiance. Set in an unassuming strip mall off of Sahara. this legendary spot is a must do. Make a reso at least 4 months ahead of time. and I recommend calling to do so. They are pretty flexible.  Don‚Äôt miss the table side ceaser. king crab. or ginormous Australian lobster tail. Their prime rib is so excellent (get it medium rare. your‚Äôre an adult not a child). the bone in ribeye is great. Service is impeccable. Amazing wine list. Don‚Äôt miss the cherries jubilee for desert or the creme brulee which is to die for.  10/10 will go every time. The only spot that can compete with over all experience with high quality food is Barry‚Äôs. Barry‚Äôs is fine. but it‚Äôs not golden steer.,5,5,5,5,June 21 2024
Delicious. Lots of food. 4 people could share the dinner for 2. That way you can save room for dessert. Great history and stories. Outstanding service. Best steak ever,5,5,5,5,June 21 2024
Tremendous service. Best steak house experience I have encountered.,5,5,5,5,June 20 2024
Outstanding service and door. A total experience. Must go when in Vegas. Book months in advance or you will not get in.,5,5,5,5,June 20 2024
Always outstanding!!! We LOVE Golden Steer Restaurant!!!,5,5,5,5,June 20 2024
We had high expectations.  but sadly. the cream corn side was the best part of the meal.  We ordered the Tomahawk steak for two. and it was OK.  My wife ended up apologizing to our waiter for using her cloth napkin to spit out quite a bit of unchewable meat.    The cocktails were good.   The best part of the experience were the attentive waiters. and it makes sense as the per table tip merits every bit of the attention received.,3,3,5,4,June 20 2024
$250 for a shared steak and lobster. Really. it is a fair value. The steak was slightly underdone and the lobster slightly overdone for my taste. Good portion size. Sherry mushrooms were tasty. Wedge salad was good. The Caesar was pretty special and worth it. Had some creme br√ªl√©e. which was nice. The Malbec at $16 a glass was a good pairing at a decent price. The ambiance is special. Sat at Mohammed Ali‚Äôs table. Pretty cool. Service was the best I have had. These guys are good. Will come back for the tomahawk some time.,5,4,5,5,June 19 2024
Food was extremely overpriced.  Waiter rolled his eyes when we asked questions,2,3,3,2,June 19 2024
Incredible food and ambience. A Las Vegas throw back with incredible service!,5,5,5,5,June 19 2024
This is a place that you must dine at once in a lifetime. The atmosphere. ambience is just wonderful and rich. We got the Sinatra booth and it made my daughters year (she is in band just started this year and really loved Frank) my fianc√© said he is a Steak snob and he doesn‚Äôt know if anyplace could measure up after his meal. The ribeye. My daughter got the Longhorn 24 oz and we all had our jaw drop when we saw it. Just wow and the flavor and seasonings were perfect. Got the Caesar salad made at table of course. unique Caesar dressing and delicious. very balanced with anchovies and egg yolk of course. service was nice and everyone was wonderful. my meal was incorrect but that could have been my fault I was going back forth between the  crab and filet or lobster and filet. Thought I said lobster but received crab. no worries because I love both and only glitch was it was cold. The steak was perfect and substantial. Everyone was so personable and meticulous. From the door man to the Maitre D and service staff and waiter. The back story and ambiance really are something to experience. The steaks are aged to perfection. Truly wonderful. Creamed corn and creamed spinach and sherry mushrooms are to die for!!!,5,4,5,5,June 19 2024
Like stepping back in time to experience 'old school' Vegas. The food was sublime. Fantastic table side presentations. Favourite meal of our holiday. Visiting is an absolute must!!!,5,5,5,5,June 19 2024
Golden Steer is the best. nothing else needs to be said.,5,5,5,5,June 19 2024
Great restaurant! Food was fantastic and the service was very prompt. Very accommodating (we arrived about 5 minutes late). Not the place for jeans and shorts even though some were dressed that way. I would arrive early because there is not a lot of parking and you might have to wait until a parking spot opens up. Would definitely go again!,5,5,5,5,June 19 2024
everything was fantastic! Service. the ambiance. the food.,5,5,5,5,June 19 2024
Love this place. I‚Äôm glad business is great. but a little sad I have to book months ahead as a local.,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
The food was awesome. Everything tasted amazing. The restaurant was awesome looking.,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Was the highlight of our Vegas trip. Our waiter was awesome and knowledgeable. Loved the history of the establishment however I'm sure Sinatra. Martin. Davis Jr..  Dimaggio and Munro wouldn't be impressed with the level of noise. It is truly a nostalgic and classy piece of Las Vegas history and have been encouraging everyone I know to visit on their next trip to Vegas.,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Food and service were beyond excellent. We got some history of the restaurant from our waiter and the gentleman that prepared our table side Cesar salad. Staff was fantastic and accommodating. Best lobster I've ever had anywhere! Will definitely keep on my bucket list to return. Menu is pricey but you definitely get what you pay for.,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Walking in has the classic Vegas vibe. There was a lot of memorabilia making it very relaxing. Great service and wonderful food,5,4,5,5,June 18 2024
Wonderful meal! One of the better steakhouses in the city!,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Most amazing lobster and steak Cesar salad made at table was great!!! Highly recommend when in Vegas go here!!!!,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Absolutely spectacular experience with delicious food!!!,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
"I was absolutely amazed! The only thing I have to say is. ""Book way earlier than you planned on being here. They are great and seats are limited. There is a good reason for that as soon as you take the first bite!""",5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Great experience! I had been wanting to try this restaurant for some time & I was not disappointed! I had the filet & lobster tail with a baked potato & Caesar salad! With the banana foster dessert it was amazing!!!,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Great food and great service. Really enjoyed my spent and would recommend it.,5,5,5,5,June 18 2024
Everything exceeded my expectations!!! Definitely will be a place to recommend and will visit again!!,5,5,5,5,June 17 2024
Enjoyed our dinner but the prices are overvalued. $270 for 2 people with tax and tip. I should have have ordered differently as we had food to take home. Should have split a dinner. The Caesar was good but croutons were like rocks.,4,4,5,5,June 17 2024
We haven‚Äôt been here in over 10 years and everything is just as amazing as we remembered!! Our steaks were cooked perfectly. sides were on point. appetizers delicious (try the bone marrow!). cocktails were perfect and the service is next level. Does not disappoint.,5,5,5,5,June 16 2024
The food and service was absolutely amazing!!!!!!!,5,5,5,5,June 16 2024
We had a wonderful experience as always!  The service was fantastic and everyone enjoyed their food and drinks!,5,4,5,4,June 16 2024
The food was amazing!  Our servers were all so attentive and kind.,5,5,5,5,June 16 2024
Went to the Golden Steer for my birthday. Overall it was an amazing experience. I can honestly say I have no complaints. The food was delicious and the lobster is a must. I can‚Äôt wait to go back to try the cherry‚Äôs jubilee. I got a free cheesecake for my birthday and left stuffed.,5,5,5,5,June 15 2024
Absolutely wonderful service! Such a cool atmosphere. Drinks were great. food was good. It wasn‚Äôt as good as I was expecting. but still very good. Definitely come here ready to spend a some money!,4,4,5,5,June 15 2024
The food was amazing. the staff was kind and courteous. and shared the history of the restaurant. Loved it all!,5,5,5,5,June 15 2024
Great food and table side service. Everything was wonderful!,5,5,5,5,June 15 2024
The steak was severely improperly cooked. It was both rare and medium,1,1,4,3,June 15 2024
Best filet. phenomenal whipped potatoes. lobster tail out of this world.  Get the table side-made Caesar salad!  First class service. pricey. but knew that going in.  Totally worth the splurge.,5,5,5,5,June 15 2024
First time. Excellent service and phenomenal food. Absolute favorite place to go for a steak! Will definitely be back!   Staff was very knowledgeable on CPR/BLS when one in my party passed out from the heat.  Definitely puts your mind at ease in this HOT weather!!!   CANNOT CANNOT say enough! Absolutely AMAZING service from all staff!!!,5,5,5,5,June 15 2024
Outstanding service and the food was sumptuous ‚ù§Ô∏è loved the attack vibe,5,5,5,5,June 14 2024
Just as experienced in the past and expected.  Fabulous,5,5,5,5,June 14 2024
Awesome was surprised food was killer. not cheap but worth it.,5,5,5,5,June 14 2024
The absolute best!! Best steak house in Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,June 14 2024
This was our first time at the Golden Steer. made reservations in February for June. I had heard negatives and positives about it and needed to see for myself.  The food. service. drinks snd ambience was OUTSTANDING!  I will definitely be back and HIGHLY recommend it.  A little pricey so be prepared. you won‚Äôt regret it though. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº,5,5,5,5,June 14 2024
Great service. nice treat when in Vegas. Expect to pay over $250 for 2 people even with no alcohol.,5,5,5,5,June 14 2024
The service here was excellent. and the food was great. the dinner for two is a pretty good deal and don‚Äôt skip dessert! Keep in mind that it is Vegas and it‚Äôs going to be expensive. My only complaint was the drink menu. the cocktails aren‚Äôt unique or anything to write home about. some of them are just sugar bombs. If you want a drink I would definitely recommend getting a martini or a glass of wine instead of any of the signature cocktails. also keep in mind the drinks will run you 20-30$ in true Vegas fashion.,4,4,4,5,June 13 2024
This was our first time here. Driven by so many times and finally made a reservation. I was pleasantly surprised they supported the Three Square Restaurant Week. We chose that menu for our dinner choice and so glad we did. The food was incredible (meatball appetizer. wedge salad. 24oz prime Longhorn New York cut steak. mac and cheese. creamed spinach and dessert. Service was top notch. It was crowded and we had an early reservation. 6:30pm. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!,5,5,5,5,June 13 2024
The steak was great not the rest of the sides or appetizers.  Bread  was bla. No flavor at all. Looks like the grab a package and just put it in a plate.  Not what we excepted from this over rated restaurant,4,3,3,3,June 12 2024
Super good steak and lobster will make a table for 8 again when I come Las Vegas again what pleasure it was for friends and family!!!!!,5,5,5,5,June 12 2024
We were there during restaurant week and ordered from the set menu for two at $80 per person.  We had the shrimp cocktail one shrimp per person and was very good.  Could have ate more than one shrimp.  Had the wedge salad.  Nothing out of the ordinary it was the typical wedge salad.  Had the 24 oz long horn for two.  The meat and seasoning were very good but not outstanding.  Would eat again.  The baked potato was good.  It was a baked potato.  The mac and cheese was very good.  For dessert we had cr√®me br√ªl√©e.  One of the best I ever had.  The service was outstanding.,4,4,5,5,June 12 2024
Nothing better that I know about in terms of food and service,5,5,5,5,June 12 2024
The food was outstanding!! We loved everything we tried and the staff and ambience were spot on!‚Äô,5,5,5,5,June 12 2024
We‚Äôve lived in vegas for 11yrs and always wanted to go here and we finally got a reservation and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Best steak I‚Äôve had in years and I could eat the Cesar salad every day. Wonderful service and loved all the fun details of history. We will be back‚Ä¶as soon as I see another open spot.,5,5,5,5,June 12 2024
Food quality and service is not up to par with the prices they charge- ridiculous pricing and the service and food quality doesn‚Äôt justify- had to send back my lobster it was over cooked and tough and my steak was not cooked right either- it became obvious as the night got later and busier- service was compromised- dissapointed - typical Vegas gouging,3,3,3,3,June 11 2024
My ribeye stack was completely burnt. Take to long to get your waiter back to the table to request something else. (another drink ).In the bar waiting to be seated the bartender was not very polite.,3,2,3,4,June 11 2024
Lived up to the legend! Everything was incredible and I would go back again and again.,5,5,5,5,June 11 2024
This was probably the best filet I‚Äôve ever had.  It was as soft as butter.  The shrimp addition was very flavorful.  And the Caesar salad delicious as always.  Staff very accommodating offering suggestions.,5,5,5,5,June 11 2024
The venue was able to accommodate my request to surprise my boyfriend with seating at the Frank Sentra booth. Most important able to keep the surprise. The food and service was amazing. So attentive and lovely. we had the dinner for 2. tomahawk steak with potato puree and asparagus and enjoyed a bottle of wine together. To end the wonderful dinner. our server surprised my boyfriend with his complementary cheesecake dessert with a candle and we also enjoyed the tiramisu. my personal favorite.,5,5,5,5,June 11 2024
Steak was tough and not what was expected. Corkage fee was 35.00 via phone call. $75.00 at restaurant. Ran out of dessert. So noisy in dining room. Couldn‚Äôt hear conversation at our own table. Not going back,1,3,3,1,June 11 2024
This may be the best meal I have ever experienced. Cooked perfectly and the flavor of all the food was amazing. Also. the service is top tier! I will be back!,5,5,5,5,June 11 2024
Great venue with red leather booths that have portraits or photos showing the personalities that preferred to b e seated in them.  Excellent food choices . we enjoyed everything that we ordered and ate. The service was impeccable and friendly. Looking forward to our next visit.,5,5,5,5,June 11 2024
We were able to get a table after getting notifications of cancels. Service was great and quick very friendly. The food was amazing. Special dessert for a bday was a sweet gesture. It was an amazing experience,5,5,5,5,June 10 2024
My youngest turned 21. and the family celebrated his birthday at the Steer. Great vibe. The service was friendly. knowledgeable. and efficient. The food was on point. Good wine list with some values available. I highly recommend it.,5,5,5,5,June 10 2024
We loved The Golden Steer!  It was everything I expected and more.  I celebrated my 60th birthday and everything was perfect.   Our waiter Andrew was amazing.   I even enjoyed the lemon drop martini!    I had the jumbo Australia lobster and my husband had the most amazing ribeye.  I have ordered the Gunslinger Ribeyes online before and had to make my way from Texas. Thank you Golden Steer for making my 60th birthday amazing.  Arie,5,5,5,5,June 10 2024
Service and food was great! James and David checked in on us throughout dinner and made sure we had everything we needed.,5,5,5,5,June 10 2024
Much anticipated visit after craving for a few years to go back. Felt tired run down - crab legs were $150ish and tasted like back door of Costco - so terrible - lobster tail was t remotely hot nor the butter - just overpriced,2,2,1,3,June 9 2024
Excellent food and service. Atmosphere gives old school Vegas mobster vibes.,5,5,5,5,June 9 2024
I have been trying for six months to get a table.  I finally had dinner there last night. June 8th. We got there before our reservation time and were seated immediately.  Every person we came in contact with was very professional and were well trained. We ordered drinks and our meal.  We started with the table side Caesar Salad. it was amazing.  Our entrees were Australian Lobster Tail. large enough to feed a small country. the 18oz cut of Prime Rib cooked a perfect medium rare.  Our sides were Cream Sherry Mushrooms. and a twice baked potato. We couldn‚Äôt pass up dessert and went with Bananas Foster. so good! Overall. we had the best experience ever and we‚Äôll be back with more people too!  Thank you Golden Steer!,5,5,5,5,June 9 2024
I have lived in Las Vegas for 31 years and this was my first visit to the Golden Steer and it did not let me down.  Everything about the experience was top notch 1st class.,5,5,5,5,June 8 2024
they set the standard for an outstanding dining experience.,5,5,5,5,June 8 2024
The food was wonderful and they were very accommodating.,5,5,5,5,June 7 2024
A steak experience that was just out of this world. Exceeded expectations in every way possible.  I have had more steak dinners then your average bear and the ‚ÄúSteer‚Äù has gained a place in my top three‚Ä¶all time.,5,5,5,4,June 7 2024
we loved the service. The salad. the lobster. the shrimp..the drinks! All so good. The steak wasn‚Äôt our favorite. But the tiramisu was to die for. It was overall so great. Super expensive. but such a great night.,5,4,5,5,June 7 2024
Best service and food. Booked 3 months in advance and was thrilled to get a reservation. It‚Äôs a must when in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,June 7 2024
Fantastic Service!  First time in Vegas and heard the restaurant was good. We became hyped after watching Tik toks and the restaraunt delivered. The service. and the food were outstanding,5,5,5,5,June 7 2024
All the hype was true and it was worth the experience.  The food was delicious and the service was exceptional!!,5,5,5,5,June 6 2024
Great meal and excellent service. Will definitely be coming back.,5,5,5,5,June 6 2024
Fabulous experience!! Service was top notch and the best we‚Äôve had in Vegas. Food was phenomenal as well. We lucked out getting a reservation off the wait list and will definitely go on our next trip! They also surprised us with a delicious piece of cheesecake for our anniversary -unexpected and a lovely touch.,5,5,5,5,June 6 2024
A must stop in Las Vegas! Excellent in every way. Loved the ambience and the staff is amazing! Ôøº,5,5,5,5,June 6 2024
It was amazing service. food and overall experience!,5,5,5,5,June 6 2024
Food quality & service very good . just a little noisy with party next table . cannot carry a conversation at all . overall . we enjoy the experience,4,4,4,4,June 6 2024
outstanding! everything was great. of course it is not cheap. but I would go again. thanks to the whole team and please keep that level up,5,5,5,5,June 5 2024
Restaurant was very busy. We were seated 25 minutes after our reservation time. Took 25 minutes for us to even request a waiter. Ordered from someone I believe was the manager 30 minutes later still no food. Then we left. Tables around us getting plenty of service. Not sure why we were overlooked.but we were. overall just a terrible experience.,1,1,1,2,June 5 2024
The service was superb along with the food.However. they should update their dress code for men.I didn't care for men coming in with t shirts that had printed stuff on it. Also . using the open table waited six months for a rush Normally on the website. it says 30 to 90 days.,5,5,5,5,June 5 2024
We had a great experience here for our first visit. Great attentive service and the food was incredible. They gave us a piece of cheesecake for a birthday which was also amazing. Came here based on reviews I‚Äôve seen and it definitely lives up to the hype. If you don‚Äôt like loud busy environments though it will not be your type of place so keep that in mind.,5,5,5,5,June 5 2024
First time there and worth the wait! Tried to get in several times before. but our patience paid off. Great meal and great service! We‚Äôll be back.,5,5,5,5,June 5 2024
Great nostalgic restaurant with a lot of ambiance.  The service was fantastic.  Caesar salad table side is a must!  We got the dinner for two with the steak and lobster.,4,4,5,5,June 5 2024
Absolutely top tier. the food was amazing and the service impeccable! Our 3 year old  grandson loved the atmosphere and the waiters tuxedo and wanted a bow tie to match the staff. The staff went above and beyond and gave him one ü©∑ That‚Äôs going above and beyond. Thank you. This place is special. beautiful atmosphere. We all enjoyed ourselves,5,5,5,5,June 5 2024
I had the restaurant week special and I was disappointed with the entree. The meat was tough. The shrimp were huge . the salad was good. the sides  were delicious and of course the dessert was on point! Thank you. The portions were huge.,4,3,5,5,June 5 2024
The steak was phenomenal‚Ä¶.. lobster and crab legs we good but not overwhelming. Service was subpar. They forgot about a soup that was ordered. then never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks till we called over the waiter. then later forgot about a coffee till we called them over. and then took 20 minutes to bring a water when asked for one of those. While the 5 waiters that helped us out were friendly. they seemed to not know their exact goal or purpose. For a $900 meal I expected top notch service. that we didn‚Äôt get.,3,5,1,5,June 4 2024
We were very impressed! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was fantastic. We‚Äôll need to come back whenever we‚Äôre in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,June 4 2024
The waitlist for the overall reservation was pretty long. We waited for over 3 months. I must say it was worth the wait. The environment was nice and quiet. The food service was great and rapid. The food was absolutely amazing. I will definitely be back again.,5,5,5,5,June 3 2024
What‚Äôs not to love about the Golden Steer ? Amazing food in an awesome setting with phenomenal service.,5,5,5,5,June 3 2024
I visit here at least once a year and the meal is a highlight every time.,5,5,5,5,June 2 2024
Wonderful staff. service. and food.  Best Caesar Salad I‚Äôve ever had.,5,5,5,5,June 2 2024
Went here for the first time for our anniversary. The hostess was able to accommodate our request for a booth. we ended up getting Frank Sinatra‚Äôs booth so that was very cool! The staff was moving at a bit of a fast pace when we were going to order and I had to ask them to repeat themselves once or twice. The food was amazing and a great value. I‚Äôd recommend the Golden Steer to anyone who wants a classic. delicious meal done exceptionally well. They also gave us a little anniversary dessert so thank you for making us feel special. We will be back. thank you so much!!,5,5,4,4,June 1 2024
We had an exceptional dining experience at the Golden Steer.,5,5,5,5,June 1 2024
First time here and everything was above and beyond expectations. Eric and Alex our team was amazing!!!  We will be back without question.,5,5,5,5,June 1 2024
Fantastic service and a phenomenal atmosphere. Golden Steer was everything they advertised. A once in a lifetime opportunity to visit one of the most iconic restaurants in Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,June 1 2024
I‚Äôve been twice before and this visit the food and service was disappointing,4,3,3,4,June 1 2024
Great food and service . A place to must go when in Vegas,5,5,5,5,May 31 2024
We really enjoyed the food and service  Will be coming back  Thanks,5,5,5,5,May 31 2024
Well what can I say! We came all the way from England to get married and had our wedding dinner here. From the moment we walked through the door to leaving was amazing. We had the Caesar salad made at our table . which was beautiful. We went for the meal for two Long Horn steak and Lobster tail. Wow‚Ä¶!  If you come to vegas you really do need to come here‚Ä¶ we will return on our next visit. Thank you to all the staff that dealt with us you were all amazing. üë∞ü§µüçæü•Ç‚ù§Ô∏èÔøº,5,5,5,5,May 31 2024
We hadn't eaten here for 10 years and worried it might not be as good. but fear not! It was marvelous! Food perfectly prepared and presented. service impeccable while not stuffy at all. and the ambiance can't be beat. Plan ahead: you need to reserve months in advance. but by all means do it!,5,5,5,5,May 31 2024
Service and food were perfection! The servers went above and beyond to make everything the best it could be. From the water glasses never going under half full to being friendly and interested in our story (celebrated our engagement). The restaurant is beautiful but can get a little noisy when full. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and the quality of meat they serve is the best I‚Äôve had in a very long time. Also highly recommend the table side Caesar salad. Getting to see each step was really interesting and then you get to enjoy one of the best salads I‚Äôve ever tasted.,5,5,5,5,May 30 2024
The best restaurant in Las Vegas. Possibly worldwide. History. food. drinks. service are all world class.,5,5,5,5,May 30 2024
Amazing as always!!! My go to steakhouse when I‚Äôm in Vegas. Love the old school Vegas vibes!!!,5,5,5,5,May 30 2024
Everything was great. food. service atmosphere but the prices were high,5,5,5,5,May 30 2024
As expected. beyond fantastic. See you again in October and DeDecember,5,5,5,5,May 30 2024
Wonderful celebration dinner! Took the in-laws for their 65 wedding anniversary. service was impeccable. New York strip. prime rib and sea bass we all prepared perfectly to order. Sides were also wonderful. only exception was the creamed spinach which was too creamy and liquid for our taste. Complimentary cheese cake for the celebration was much appreciated. Highly recommend. we shall return!,5,5,5,5,May 29 2024
Great service. food cooked to perfection. and the ambience of the place is amazing!,5,5,5,5,May 29 2024
An incredible experience all round. Fabulous food. fabulous service. Authentic decor. The Golden Steer runs like a well-oiled machine. Absolutely worth what we paid!!,5,5,5,5,May 29 2024
I booked this restaurant almost six months in advance and it was well worth the wait! All of the waiters and host/hostesses were absolutely wonderful! I love how they greet every guest and are frequently checking on guests. We also got seated at a legends booth (Sammy Davis Jr.) I also loved how there is a dress code so it took you back to how Las Vegas was in what I would call the good days! I wish more places were like this. but on the other hand that‚Äôs what made this place even more special. Depending on how busy the place is you may even get some great stories of how this place was when legends such as Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin dined there. I cannot wait to come back to this place!,5,5,5,5,May 29 2024
The service was great. However. the beef was not that great. There was barely any sear. and the butter they recommend for steaks overpowers the beef flavor. I was disappointed.,3,3,4,5,May 29 2024
Amazing staff. food is top notch. prices were great. Staff had amazing recommendations and wine pairing. Would love to dine here again.,5,5,5,5,May 29 2024
This was our second time here. Our experience the first time was wonderful! The service from our server David was always great! I ordered the Australia  Lobster Tail and my husband the King Crab legs that he wanted to try. We both split the porterhouse steak. The only disappointment was from my husband because when he received his crab legs. they were thin and only three. He wasn't expecting the crab legs to be cut in half so there was less meat. For the price he paid which was more than the lobster tail. he was very disappointed.,5,4,5,5,May 28 2024
First time at Gokden Steer.I will definitely be a return customer. Excellent food and service,5,5,5,5,May 28 2024
We are regular diners at Golden Steer.  Food and service are consistently excellent.  Management and staff genuinely appreciate their customers and it shows from the moment you arrive until you are bidding good night.  If you have never dined at Golden Steer do yourself a favor and book a reservation.  I recommend calling to do so.,5,5,5,5,May 28 2024
This place is great! My husband and I are locals and we always wanted to come here. We will definitely be back. Every staff member is on the top of their game and genuinely seemed like they wanted to make sure we were having a good experience. The food was amazing. The cocktails were fabulous. the appetizer could be a meal all on its own. the steaks cooked to perfection. the sides were a perfect paring to the entree. and the deserts were a perfect ending.  The ambiance had the perfect amount of liveliness with it disrupting the meal. Just make sure to make a reservation. and it will be the best meal you will have in Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,May 27 2024
I recently dined at Golden Steer. and I was thoroughly impressed. The highlight of my meal was the tomahawk steak. which was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Additionally. the tableside Caesar salad presentation was a delightful experience. showcasing both the skill and attention to detail of the staff. This combination of exceptional food and engaging service made for an unforgettable dining experience. Highly recommended!,5,5,5,5,May 26 2024
Blown away by the cleanliness and attention to every detail. The Caesar Salad is ridiculously good. and the ribeye was the best we have ever had.,5,5,5,5,May 26 2024
Everything was excellent and as described. the signature cocktails were a surprise since my focus had been on the food.,5,5,5,5,May 26 2024
Wonderful experience. the food is great. the staff and presentation makes it next level! 10/10,5,5,5,5,May 26 2024
We love Golden Steer!!! We ordered fried calamari. lobster tail. bone in rib eye. and banana fritters. Hands down the best steak house! Well worth the money.,5,5,5,5,May 26 2024
Amazing food and wonderful service. We‚Äôve been dying to try this place and it did not disappoint.,5,5,5,5,May 26 2024
Very nice place.  Many great options.  Definitely recommend.,5,5,5,5,May 25 2024
10/10 all the way around. not easily impressed but the staff did a great job from back of house all the way to the table,5,5,5,5,May 25 2024
One of the best meals we‚Äôve ever had. Incredible steak and atmosphere. Service was excellent. This restaurant truly encapsulates the Vegas Experience. We‚Äôll be back every time we come to town!,5,5,5,5,May 24 2024
Visit #25 and the very first visit. And nothing has changed. Perfection every time!,5,5,5,5,May 24 2024
Really expecting more than they gave. Service was ok. nothing bad but nothing special. Average ambiance.  Steaks were very good taste wise. cooked a bit uneven across the meat. Lobster was awesome. King Crabs were very fishy‚Ä¶went in a Thursday night so maybe better on a Friday when new shipment comes in.  Caesar salad was good and recommend but nothing spectacular. Over good dinner and experience. Bit overpriced and expectations built up by too much!,4,4,4,5,May 24 2024
An absolutely amazing dining experience.  My second time on property and they delivered with 5 star everything!!  My sincere thanks and we‚Äôll be back!!,5,5,5,5,May 24 2024
Das Essen war bis auf das Filet 12 OZ sehr gut.  Hier wohl leider kein zartes St√ºck erhalten. Aussenst√ºck. Erst war es blutig (bestellt Medium) dann zu durch.,4,4,5,5,May 23 2024
Absolutely remarkable! The oysters were insane. so was the lobster tail. Service 10/10!,5,5,5,5,May 23 2024
The staff and ambiance are outstanding. We ordered the tomahawk for two. which came with two sides and a Caesar salad. The creamed spinach. prime mac and cheese. and salad were excellent and definitely worth it.  Unfortunately. we were disappointed with the steak. We requested medium-rare but received it medium. half of the steak was over cooked and it lacked flavor. The quality of the steak was questionable. and it did not seem to be dry-aged. Considering the cost. it was definitely not worth it.  Overall. this place is more about the experience than the steak. which was disappointing.,3,1,5,5,May 23 2024
You‚Äôre paying for the experience. The food is mediocre at best. Over $400 for 3 of us was a bit much for a dry steak and even dryer lobster tail. but at least we got the experience of going. Staff was great although they only really had male servers. Not very diverse.,3,2,5,4,May 23 2024
A wonderful experience with table side salad and desert. The prime rib. NY cut and porterhouse steaks were perfect. Exceed my families expectations.,5,5,5,5,May 23 2024
Overall good experience but 6 months ago I asked for the Sinatra table and upon arrival I was told it was not available  üòî,4,5,5,4,May 22 2024
We loved everything about this experience!  Definitely will be coming back!  The food was amazing‚Ä¶ not one item wasn‚Äôt a 10 out of 10!,5,5,5,5,May 21 2024
Food was excellent. but came for the experience & the staff did not disappoint!,5,5,5,5,May 21 2024
I have been wanting to try this place for a while and was finally able to get a reservation. I am so glad I had the opportunity to experience this. The service was incredible. the food was delicious. the drinks were good. Had a great time and highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,May 21 2024
Best steakhouse in Vegas! The service and food is top notch. I‚Äôll definitely be returning and recommend making reservations months in advance.,5,5,5,5,May 21 2024
Service and food were terrific. Even after the food was waiting to be delivered the waiters and staff were very attentive and kind. The only flaw was the reservation took longer when we showed up. That‚Äôs basically only negative. Steaks were cooked to perfection as well as the Fried Calamari!,5,5,5,5,May 21 2024
Great steakhouse service was excellent David our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the history of the place.. My only complaint would be I wish my steak would have been served hotter.. other than that everything was great ..,4,4,5,5,May 21 2024
Got a great table. waiter and food! We will definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,May 20 2024
The steak and lobster meal for two was phenomenal.  The lobster melted in your mouth and the steak cooked to perfection.  The French onion soup was outstanding.  The table-side banana foster was divine and complimentary Anniversary cheese cake a wonderful surprise.  The staff was friendly and attentive. atmosphere nostalgic. and everyone was so kind.  Well worth the wait and price!,5,5,5,5,May 20 2024
First. we asked to be seated in the bar. Without expecting patrons to be hovering over our plates and loudly talking. Server expertly weaved through them and delivered delicious food! Chef shook our hands after we asked him to come and take a bow. Next time seated I‚Äôll be in restaurant üòÄüëç,4,5,5,3,May 19 2024
If you love salt this is your place. This is such a popular restaurant and we have waited a long time to visit but we will not be back. The food just wasn‚Äôt to our liking. The well known Caesar salad was way too garlicky and salty and I couldn‚Äôt eat it. The twice baked potato and side broccoli were too salty. The prime rib and filet were excellent. The service was great but I did have to fill my wine glass at one point which surprised me. It‚Äôs a nice restaurant but just not for me.,4,2,4,4,May 19 2024
Loved the golden steer didnt like the shorthorn cut of meat way to chewy and not tender. I would try another cut next time. I would definitely come back to give it another shot.,5,3,5,5,May 19 2024
Great food and service experience.  Very noisy and vibrant atmosphere. True old school Vegas restaurant.  Nice show presentation of Caesars salad and Banana‚Äôs Foster.  Excellent wine and cocktail selection.  Good piece of steak and fresh lobster tails.,4,5,5,5,May 19 2024
Our experience was flawless from start to finish. The atmosphere. decor and feel of this place is like something out of a movie. then there‚Äôs the food.. best steak I‚Äôve ever had and the sides were just as good. The real bonus though. we got sat in. in my opinion. the best booth in the whole place. Frank Sinatra‚Äôs booth. The service is exceptional. they give you a little bit of history about the restaurant and make sure it is fine dining at its best. whilst still maintaining a super friendly and relaxed vibe. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone not loving this place.,5,5,5,5,May 18 2024
Still the best Steak house in Las Vegas.  The history of the restaurant is always fascinating. The staff was outstanding. never had to re ask for anything. Never had to asks for drinks.  They were very attentive and on point.   This is a must for anyone,5,5,5,5,May 18 2024
Golden Steer is our go to when in Vegas. Its a true gem and we are never disappointed with our dining expreience.,5,5,5,5,May 17 2024
We celebrated our 30-year anniversary and they couldn't have made us feel more special. The meal was absolutely phenomenal. Service was over the top. Thank you,5,5,5,5,May 17 2024
Best steak I‚Äôve had in a long time! The baked potatoes could have been cooked longer. but everything else was excellent!,5,5,5,5,May 17 2024
The service was friendly. courteous and ready with a smile. I had the filet mignon and it was absolute perfection from the first bite. I almost melted in my seat. Mac and cheese was creamy. cheesy and flavorful the way it should be. Dinner rolls were served warm. yummy! Cocktails were tasty too! Definitely coming back!,5,5,5,5,May 16 2024
Food was cold and less than what I would have expected,1,1,3,2,May 16 2024
Great food and great service! Cocktails were also on point.,5,5,5,4,May 16 2024
Loved up to all the hype. Service. ambiance. attention to detail. drinks. and the food were all 5 stars. I can‚Äôt wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,May 16 2024
Delicious food and great service! Will definitely come back again!,5,5,5,5,May 16 2024
A great luxurious place to have dinner. The food was delicious. the service was incredible. A must if you are visiting Las Vegas. Reservations are hard to find so book in advance.,5,5,5,5,May 15 2024
Time and time again I see myself returning to this place.  When you are a foodholic like me you come to appreciate a good bone in ribeye.  Well. they have the best I have ever had.  There is no other place in the United States where you can eat this which melts in your mouth after the first bite.,5,5,5,5,May 15 2024
Incredible experience and table side service. Expect to pay - but the history. ambiance. service and food makes the whole experience worth it.,5,5,5,5,May 14 2024
Amazing food but service was mediocre.  Had several servers but our main server was not a very pleasant person.  This is our second time at Golden Steer and our first time was absolutely amazing.  Our second experience made Golden steer feel like an average steakhouse.  Servers make or break places like Golden Steer.,4,5,1,5,May 14 2024
Not enough words to describe what an incredible experience we had at the Golden Steer. Making our 70th visit to Vegas we cannot believe we never dined here and NOW we will definitely make this restaurant a must when returning. The staff was incredible. Justen was unbelievable. The Caesar Salad presentation was awesome and the Salad was the best ever! Steak was perfect and the Bananas Foster was out of this world. The nostalgia ambiance is everywhere! Advice: Make your reservations about 3 months in advance!,5,5,5,5,May 14 2024
Bryan our waiter was amazing! Expensive meal but would pay it again for the experience and service! Worth a visit,5,5,5,5,May 14 2024
Wendy and Jake demonstrated exceptional customer service. The food and drinks were outstanding. and the wait staff were excellent. Definitely worth the flight in for dinner celebrating my son‚Äôs birthday. What a memorable evening! Thank you!!,5,5,5,5,May 14 2024
Incredible. Born and raised in Las Vegas. 53 years and this is my first time. 5 stars from the service. food and atmosphere. Can‚Äôt believe it took this long to try. We will be back!,5,5,5,5,May 14 2024
It lived up to the hype.  Old school service.  Excellent!,5,5,5,5,May 13 2024
This place is amazing. It's well worth the wait to get a good table. The food is top-notch. I had the 18oz dry aged prime rib. It was absolutely the best I have ever had.,5,5,5,5,May 13 2024
We had a fabulous dinner for my son‚Äôs 21st Birthday everything was fabulous I booked this reservation in Feb for our May trip .  Pricey but was an amazing dinner food was beyond amazing !,5,5,5,5,May 13 2024
Always a pleasure to dine at the Golden Steer. Place gets better each time I go. Reservations need to be made well in advance. I‚Äôd say 3 months at a minimum.,5,5,5,5,May 13 2024
My family and I had a wonderful Mother‚Äôs Day dinner. From the seafood to the steak. everything was delicious and we walked away full and satisfied. The waiting staff was friendly. accommodating. and professional. I loved how they open the doors for you as you walk in. My family and I would totally eat here again.,5,5,5,5,May 13 2024
Ordered the lobster tail. Was mushy and not what I expected salad was ok . They were accommodating and comp my lobster tail but still disappointing considering we had to wait 3 months for reservations.  My personal opinion not worth the expense.,3,2,5,4,May 12 2024
Very disappointed with the food. The Caesar salad and twice baked potato were great. but the steak and other sides were mid at best. The lobster tail was overcooked. The service was great. but the food was not worth it.,3,2,5,5,May 12 2024
Perfect dinner! Pricey. but worth it for the experience (ask for one of the Rat Pack booths).,5,5,5,5,May 12 2024
Great service. place is filled with so much Rich history! A must see! Food was incredible!,5,5,5,5,May 11 2024
Lives up to all expectations! Will definitely be back!,5,5,5,5,May 11 2024
Disappointed.  Food was average but service was very good.,3,3,5,4,May 11 2024
It was absolutely worth the hype. Service was second to none. Can't wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,May 11 2024
The service and food are amazing. We were lucky enough to get a booth and it did not disappoint.  The table side Ceasar and Cherries Jubilee were so good.,5,5,5,5,May 11 2024
Amazing food and atmosphere. Never disappointed.  Cr√®me br√ªl√©e is amazing. All the food is amazing. Highly recommend anyone to go.,5,5,5,5,May 10 2024
Tick Tock & Instagram lied‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no butter luge! ü§£ BUT all the food was 10/10! YUM!,5,5,5,4,May 10 2024
"Excellent!! *****  Transcends time!  Wonderful atmosphere & ambiance...Fabulous food & outstanding service!!  Definitely add the tableside ""Cherries Jubilee"" for dessert !!  Thank you Golden Steer!!",5,5,5,5,May 10 2024
Fantastic experience and great food. Bananas foster was amazing!,5,5,5,5,May 10 2024
It was truly an amazing experience. from the food to the service. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to have a great meal.,5,5,5,5,May 9 2024
Don‚Äôt believe the hype and all the You Tube shorts and instagram pictures of the huge lobster tails and fork cutting steaks. Waited months for this reservation. Prices are exorbitant for small portions and low quality food. Both my husband and I were ill the next day losing a part of our vacation time. Two tables had drunk patrons. The table next to ours called the manager regarding one of the tables as the other had left by that time. The manager comped that table beverages. dessert. and spent time speaking to the party apologizing for what had occurred. However. he never thought to come to our table to address our experience or offer his apologies. The food arrived overcooked and tepid in temperature. By the time someone came to check on us. the lobster was stone cold and dry. No amount of lukewarm butter could fix it. I have had better lobster tails at the Palms buffet and red lobster. Even the steak is better at Outback! The crab appetizer was more ice than meat and the drinks were finished after 4 sips or had so much liquor they could not be consumed. We finally got minimal attention paid to us when we said we wanted no dessert or coffee and just the bill. It really felt as if our patronage was less valuable than others. There is no dress code as the table on the opposite side of us. (which was a table of six so I‚Äôm sure the bill was very high) had women with tank tops. shorts and flip-flops. This was such a disappointment and we will not return. If management responds I‚Äôm sure the only thing they‚Äôll say is we‚Äôll do better next time and please give us another chance to make it right. I will not waste hundreds of dollars to give this establishment another chance. They should do the right thing. Return the hundreds of dollars we paid back to our credit card. learn from the mistakes and call it a day. As I suspected. Golden Steer responded and takes no accountability for its missteps. poor service and lack of quality food.  They only validate good reviews!,1,1,1,2,May 9 2024
The staff was super friendly and amazing with key notes and details. I loved the food cooked to my perfection and for my first time trying a lobster tail it was very very good. I would definitely recommend.,5,4,5,5,May 9 2024
Everything we hoped it would be. We will be back in the future.,5,5,5,5,May 9 2024
Best place in Vegas!!  Nothing comes close!!  Stop wasting your money on the strip!!,5,5,5,5,May 9 2024
The most fantastic dinner and service I‚Äôve ever had in Las Vegas and I‚Äôve eaten at a lot of great restaurants and lived here for 35 years. Everything was perfect from the minute we walked in the door.,5,5,5,5,May 9 2024
I have tried for years to get a last minute reservation at Golden Steer.  This visit to Vegas was well planned out so I made the reservation as soon as they opened up two months in advance.  It was well worth the wait! It truly lives up to its reputation! We highly recommend this Vegas Icon!,5,5,5,5,May 8 2024
Everything was outstanding! I would recommend this fine establishment to anyone!,5,5,5,5,May 8 2024
Mmmmm. Gooder. Always a must visit when in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,May 8 2024
We celebrated my 50th and my daughter in law‚Äôs birthday as well. There was a total of 9 in our party. Everything was amazing. The staff was very accommodating and we were very happy with the food and the overall experience.,5,5,5,4,May 8 2024
Great part of  LV history. the service was way over the top GREAT. food very good. overall. a wonderful experience.,5,4,5,5,May 8 2024
Excellent food! Excellent service! What a fabulous Vegas experience!,5,5,5,5,May 7 2024
What an amazing restaurant! Can‚Äôt wait to come back. Sat at the bar until our table was ready and had a great evening at the restaurant. Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,May 7 2024
Absolutely amazing! It wasn‚Äôt just dinner. it was a whole experience! Impeccable service. The best steak ever. We had a great conversation with the sommelier and loved the wine he suggested. Everything above and beyond from start to finish. Our favorite memory from Vegas.,5,5,5,5,May 7 2024
Golden Steer wasn't as great as I'd hoped.  The food for the extreme price did not hold up unfortunately.  I wasn't overwhelmed or impressed.,3,3,4,5,May 7 2024
The food and ambiance were good. the service was fine but our server was busy with a large party the majority of the time (it seemed like he knew he would make a bigger tip from them) and paid us minimal attention. Most of our food/wine was brought by other team members. including the tableside salad. It‚Äôs too bad because we were celebrating our wedding and would have liked to have a 10/10 experience.,4,5,3,5,May 7 2024
OUTSTANDING!!!!  We were seated quickly. Our drinks were so delicious. I recommend the spice it up!  The shrimp dejonghe and the caesar was so filing and full of flavor.  Armando made our table side Caesar. and our desert table side. Gave us little facts and recommendations for our entrees.  The steaks we ordered were all cooked precisely how we requested. The seasoning was so great we didn‚Äôt need any additional sides or condiments. The Mac and cheese is a classic Broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked. Bananas foster was a perfect split for our party of 3.  10/10 all the way!,5,5,5,5,May 7 2024
Service and ambiance were excellent. Ôøº Our salad had way too much dressing so we didn‚Äôt eat them. The steak came out undercooked so we sent it back then it came out overcooked.,4,3,4,5,May 7 2024
Food was just OK .  Service wasn‚Äôt up to fine dining.  Dirty steak knive was give to me for next course. never crumb my table. Service was not up to standard for that price point.   To many other steak places to go . Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back,2,2,2,2,May 7 2024
Absolutely fabulous experience. and the steak was amazing. We had petite steaks Oscar style and our other friend crab legs. Everything was cooked to perfection. and the staff was wonderful.  We also got a slice of chocolate cake they presented to us for our bday. and it was so good and rich. Definitely had to share. My dirty vodka martini was perfect with blue cheese olives as well. This place is worth every penny.,5,5,5,5,May 6 2024
The food was just not good. No flavor. on any of the dishes I tried. For the price I was expecting something immaculate. especially waiting for a reservation for 3+ months. Honestly just very disappointed. would not come here again. :(  The service itself was good. kept waters filled. and ask if we needed anything constantly. The restaurant itself was very beautiful in the inside. I just don't recommend eating here . don't let the TikToks fool you! ü´†,3,1,3,4,May 6 2024
amazing food. amazing drinks. amazing service. definitely worth the hype!! can‚Äôt wait to come back!!,5,5,5,5,May 6 2024
10/10 would recommend. Staff was very polite and attentive. Best meal I‚Äôve ever had.,5,5,5,5,May 6 2024
Had the 40 oz Tomahawk for 2. There was 3 of us and it was plenty.  Was fantastic!   Only thing I found odd is the bathrooms are like going into a school bathroom. Sorta like entering a completely different building.. so outdated and not fancy or even well kept.  For this type of dining you would expect an updated fancy bathroom.  For the price tag on the menu. seems they can afford to upgrade it a bit!,5,5,5,5,May 4 2024
Not really worth the hype. Drinks and ceasar salad are the best part,3,1,5,4,May 4 2024
This is my favorite restaurant!! The food was perfect! The service was great!!! I can‚Äôt wait to come back.,5,5,5,5,May 4 2024
Food was absolutely amazing. Steaks were cooked to perfection. The shrimp cocktail was out of this world. I‚Äôve never seen shrimp that big and meaty. Wait staff was very knowledgable and helpful without being overbearing,5,5,5,5,May 4 2024
Great seafood and ambiance. Sides were amazing. Steak was a little bit bland and tough.,5,4,5,5,May 3 2024
Absolutely a wonderful experience. Every time I travel to Vegas I will definitely plan on visiting again.,5,5,5,5,May 3 2024
Our waiters were the best really make you feel like gold,5,5,5,5,May 3 2024
Food was delicious but we waited a little while for our main dish. The place is very classic. very unique experience!,4,5,4,5,May 3 2024
Everything was a 10. It's my second time coming to celebrate my birthday. I wish I would have know guests could literally wear whatever. I saw shorts. tennis shoes & sandals but now I know. I told certain guests they couldn't come because of the dress code.,5,5,5,5,May 3 2024
Loved the whole experience. We did the table side Caesars salad. 8oz filet medium rare and prime rib medium rare - all perfectly cooked and the best filet we‚Äôve had. Service was great!,5,5,5,5,May 3 2024
The best steak!! The Tomahawk was delicious. We shared it with 3 people and it was more than enough. It came with a cute lil jar of seasoning. And the caesar salad and Sangiovese wine was the best i‚Äôve ever had. Love it here. so glad i was able to get a reservation‚Ä¶ even though I had to book 5 months in advance lol,5,5,5,5,May 2 2024
The food was excellent. I enjoyed myself so much. Just really delicious!!!! I will really go back the next time we are in Vegas.,5,5,5,4,May 2 2024
10s across the board. Great service and food. Definitely would recommend.,5,5,5,5,May 2 2024
We dine here everytime we travel to Vegas. We have had our daughter's engagement dinner here. The food. service and atmosphere does not disappoint and this trip was no different. We always look forward to the table side Caesar sald.,5,5,5,5,May 2 2024
An exceptional dining experience at the steak house! From the moment we walked in. the ambiance was inviting and the service was impeccable. The steaks were cooked to perfection. juicy and flavorful. accompanied by delicious sides. The attention to detail and quality of ingredients truly set this place apart. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-notch steakhouse experience!,5,5,5,5,May 2 2024
Let‚Äôs start with the appetizers - I was shocked that they brought our Caesar salad over to do it table side but it wasn‚Äôt . he never cracked an egg and was already acting like it was something he was mixing together but I saw that it was already dressed and had everything in it but the croutons? - I noticed the other tables had the entirety of the salad prepared at there tables. I felt very cheated. I thought maybe it was because it was only for 1 person but I noticed that other tables had only 1 salad and again it was entirely prepared at the table. My salad was room temperature- not cold or even chilled. like it had been sitting. Very noticeable and as I was on a date with someone I wanted to empress I didn‚Äôt complain. but I‚Äôm going to let people know here. I also had the French onion soup - was amazing! I would recommend it. broth was hot and the cheese was perfect and melted‚Ä¶ Now let‚Äôs move onto the Main Course - a  $88 Porter House - was very tiny and I am not sure if they have a new chef in the kitchen but the steak Was medium rare- the steak was Only Cooked on 1 Side! The other side was getting some sort of residual heat and looked like it had been steamed? No char-marks. no crusting. but the other side looked great. Very extremely shocked. and 1/3 of the top of the meat was pure gristle. I was horrified and cooked day anything again. as I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass a person whom I am not sure how they would react. The Whipped Mash as a side was edible but also room temperature. had a film on them. and were cold after a few minutes at the table. The potatoes became almost unbearable to eat. We also had dessert and felt that the jubilee was over powered by the amount of orange zest used and not enough 151‚Ä¶ I would definitely recommend saying something about your food if you are able as the price and the experience is what you‚Äôre paying for and shouldn‚Äôt be subpar.,3,3,4,4,May 2 2024
This was our best dining experience in Las Vegas. We have been to all of the top steakhouses in and around the area and considering the complete experience the Golden Steer was the best hands down.,5,5,5,5,May 1 2024
Exceptional!!!  The best atmosphere and service I've ever enjoyed while dining.,5,5,5,5,May 1 2024
Just brilliant. Careful. considered and timely service. Awesome food. best we‚Äôve had this trip. Knowledgeable wine guy. couldn‚Äôt fault it.,5,5,5,5,May 1 2024
Best dinning experience! Great atmosphere with music suitable for the surroundings at a perfect level to enjoy. The best NY strip steak and cooked to perfection. So many staff and every one so friendly and attentive. An expensive night but definitely worth it. Would be the first place I‚Äôd book on a return trip to Las Vegas. Thank you. especially for the birthday cheesecake! üéâ,5,5,5,5,May 1 2024
Fantastic place to go for food! From steaks. lobster tails to their appetizersÔøº- HIGHLY recommend to everyone,5,5,5,5,May 1 2024
The best ala-carte 5 star service I have experienced since moving to Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,April 30 2024
amazing customer service and food! the only thing is that it‚Äôs hard to get someone on the phone - during open hours. no one answers.,5,5,5,5,April 30 2024
It was a very enjoyable experience. Service was outstanding. Environment was so great and seeing amd hearing about the culture of the steakhouse was so cool. Food was amazing. Very impressed and will gladly brag about it to everyone!,5,5,5,5,April 29 2024
We have been passing by this place for years and finally made it. We were celebrating a birthday and they made it extra special. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. I feel like the servers went above and beyond. We are planning to return to celebrate other birthdays and special occasions.  Thank you for a great experience!,5,5,5,5,April 29 2024
Impeccable service and great food.  Steak melts in your mouth.,5,5,5,5,April 29 2024
It took four months to get a table. Yes it was worth it. But it is very very expensive! Nice atmosphere and the food is good.,5,5,5,5,April 28 2024
Great food and great service would recommend it to seafood and steak lovers,5,5,5,5,April 28 2024
Excellent service and good! Best filthy martini in Las Vegas!!,5,5,5,5,April 28 2024
The experience exceeded my expectations. From the moment we got there till we left. the staff made us feel welcome and special. Our request for a booth was granted with the Mario Andretti booth. Thank you! The food was excellent. As well as the atmosphere. I will definitely remember this experience for the rest of my life.,5,5,5,5,April 27 2024
The food and drinks were excellent and so was the service!,5,5,5,5,April 26 2024
Fantastic service with a fantastic meal and experience,5,5,5,5,April 26 2024
Most delicious meal we ever had in Las Vegas! The wedge salad had fantastic blue cheese dressing! The prime rib and filet mignon was out of this world and cooked perfectly! The flavor was amazing!,5,5,5,5,April 26 2024
Overall one of the best meals I've ever had. Great food. Great Service. The history makes this place a unique and memorable meal but you will pay for it! This place a worth a place in your budget on a visit to Vegas.,5,5,5,5,April 26 2024
I had an amazing time with my wife. Customer service was phenomenal and Wendy coming over to our table was a very nice touch. I came for my birthday and was not disappointed. Cheers to continuous success. Robert,5,5,5,5,April 26 2024
Everything here at Golden Steer was absolutely exceptional! We got the dean cut of prime rib (48 oz). a huge lobster tail. lamb chops and a couple sides. The prime rib was definitely wet aged and extremely juicy by far the biggest and best piece of prime rib I‚Äôve had! I appreciate the accommodation of making that piece! Everyone was professional. down to earth and outstanding customer service! Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre able to get a reservation!!!,5,5,5,5,April 25 2024
Overall great. Just pricey for 4. No alcohol and still 700,4,5,5,4,April 25 2024
Cozy atmosphere. Delicious food! Make your reservation asap. They are booked way out for a reason.,5,5,5,5,April 25 2024
Food was flavorful and portions were fair. However. was very disappointed with the service we received. Did not appreciate that it seemed as though staff was picking and choosing what tables to give more attention to. Our plates piled up on our table through the whole meal and drinks went empty as many staff just walked right by our table with no care at all. Really unfortunate to be treated this way and have this experience. especially having a reservation months in advance and traveling from out of state.,3,5,1,4,April 25 2024
The meal was amazing so delicious. We were seated in a booth and the service was exceptional,5,5,5,4,April 25 2024
Great food and service! The food was absolutely delicious. Very rich. a lot of flavor. Service from the staff was excellent. Only complaint was that my entree order took a while to come out. Definitely recommend ordering a salad or app to eat during the wait. But it was at prime time of their dinner service. Overall. great place!,4,5,5,4,April 25 2024
Not worth the six month wait to get a reservation.. Food was good but nothing special. Highly overrated IMO..,4,3,5,4,April 25 2024
Amazing experience from the food to the ambiance and service. A must try when in Vegas.,5,4,5,5,April 24 2024
The steak was ok lobster was ok. The garlic Parmesan broccoli was not cooked and had no flavor. Waited a long time to get a reservation so maybe the expectations were too high. Have already told family members to cancel their upcoming reservation.,3,3,3,3,April 23 2024
Highly recommend. Food was delicious and the entire staff were wonderful. We got the shrimp app. Caesar salad. Filet and crab legs. We will definitely be coming back.,5,5,5,5,April 23 2024
We were so glad to be able to have dinner at the Golden Steer while in Vegas! It was by far some of the best food we have all ever tasted. The table side Cesar salad is a must! We also had the shrimp cocktail. steak. lobster and for dessert. the table side cherry jubilee.(it was a lot of food but so SOOO EXCELLENT) It isn‚Äôt cheap but it was a complete experience we will all never forget. The service from everyone was outstanding. Alex did our table side preparations and was very engaging and fun to talk to. Jesse was a magician clearing dishes. He would kind of slide in quietly and take empty plates out of servers hands as they spoke to the diners. He didn‚Äôt miss a beat and was so professional and fun to watch. Spencer was our main server and he was very attentive. the perfect balance. His timing was spot on.he never interrupted our party but was always there if we had a question. These 3 men are clearly some of the best in the business. Absolutely excellent. The history of the restaurant is so neat. allow time to check out the memoriabilia. It was a perfect Vegas evening. Even the young doorman (I wish I could remember his name. He is engaged to be married) was so friendly and asked us how our meal and experience was. Make sure to book reservations well in advance. We booked 3 months ahead of time which seems to be the norm.,5,5,5,5,April 23 2024
It was our first time dining at the Golden Steer. Our friends had recommended it to us so we decided to try it.  Our server was so attentive and friendly. He made recommendations and told us of the history of the restaurant. even taking us on a tour after dinner. There are many steakhouses inÔøº Las Vegas. and we‚Äôve eaten at quite a few of them. I have to say that the Golden steer was the best that we‚Äôve had.  I just found my receipt and our server‚Äôs name was Justen. He deserves kudos for his top notch service.,5,5,5,5,April 23 2024
Best lobster I‚Äôve had in a while. Steak did not have a lot of flavor/seasoning on the crust for a med steak but the beef was good.,4,3,5,5,April 23 2024
Absolutely fantastic service. food and the history of the place is amazing will return agin,5,5,5,5,April 23 2024
We had so much fun!!!! So glad we were able to experience a dinner here!!,5,5,5,5,April 23 2024
Quite the experience I loved going there. A wonderful evening!Ôøº,5,5,5,5,April 22 2024
Service was impeccable. food was excellent. A true historical gem!,5,5,5,5,April 22 2024
You would not know from the exterior what the experience would be. We were a party of 8 for a later reservation. Our main server was James and Thomas made our Caesar salad table side. Both were FANTASTIC! Unfortunately. we had 2 issues from the other staff members. One other waiter got nasty and loud with my wife over her chair not being pushed in and she couldn‚Äôt move fast enough to adjust it because of her back condition. The place had a loud vibe and apparently we were singled out as being too loud and using inappropriate language. The nasty waiter issue was never addressed nor did we receive an apology. instead the female manager felt it was better to argue with us. I guess if our last names were Sinatra or Martin that would NOT have been an issue. We will NOT be returning to the Golden Steer for any of our future yearly Vegas trips.,3,5,5,5,April 21 2024
Didn‚Äôt feel worth the $.  Caesar salad was too acidic.  Change away from wood mixing pool made a difference.  Steak was too buttery.  Desert was let down.  Wine was good however!,2,3,2,4,April 21 2024
Table side prep of Caesar salad and the cherries jubilee are both a MUST.  The steaks were excellent and service top notch. Don‚Äôt let the dress code fool you- other parties are there having a great time and the noise level can be challenging depending on where you‚Äôre seated. But it‚Äôs Vegas and easy to be happy for everyone celebrating something special.,4,5,5,3,April 21 2024
What and incredible experience! It‚Äôs worth all the hype and the price. Service was excellent and food was delicious. I recommend to anyone and will come back again!,5,5,5,5,April 21 2024
Lived up to all our expectations. We started with the meatball appetizer. French onion soup. and table prepared caesar salads. All were delicious. We got the sea bass and petite filet entrees. The sea bass was seasoned perfectly and the steak was deliciously tender. For dessert we chose the table side cherries jubilee and carrot cake. The carrot cake was amazing. The cream cheese frosting was perfect. The spectacle of the cherries jubilee preparation made it worth the calories.,5,5,5,5,April 20 2024
Been here a number of times. Reserved months in advance for a special dinner for 6. Our table looked directly into the restroom. Not a great ambiance when you are paying over $1000 for a meal and are looking at a toilet every time someone enters the washroom. Really took the shine off the meal.,3,4,4,1,April 20 2024
Amazing experience. Food and service were levels above what we expected.,5,5,5,5,April 19 2024
Great food as  usual had a great time on my birthday,5,5,5,5,April 19 2024
Food was great. we shared a steak and lobster. huge portion and both beautifully and perfectly cooked. Ceaser salad best we‚Äôve ever had and the bananas fosters was fabulous! Staff were the greatest! Will definitely come back next time in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,April 19 2024
We had agreed great experience.  Steak melted in our mouth. So many choices and everything we ordered was fantastic.  We will be back.,5,5,5,5,April 18 2024
My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas my bill was 700 with tip and i don't regret it at all!,5,5,5,4,April 18 2024
My fianc√© and I were super excited to try the steaks at the golden steer. but I will say it was over hyped. The salad was the best dish. which is hard to say for a steak house. The service and atmosphere was exceptional. steak was subpar for the price.,3,2,5,5,April 18 2024
Flawless experience. The food is off the charts good and the service was impeccable. I can‚Äôt wait to go back. They had one of the best Brandy Old Fashion (sweet) cocktails I have ever had. the lobster was perfect and I recommend the mushrooms and twice baked potatoes as sides. Thanks to all of the servers who took such amazing care of us.,5,5,5,5,April 18 2024
Amazing Steak and Sides. Top notch service. Been multiple times.,5,5,5,5,April 18 2024
French onion soup and Caesar salad are the only items worth eating. Steak was missing the nice sear. Mac and cheese had no flavor. Broccoli was under cooked. Mushrooms were in a thick sauce. We‚Äôve been waiting for months to eat here and are so disappointed with the food. Ambiance was dark and fairly loud. Service was excellent. Too expensive for crappy food.,2,1,5,2,April 18 2024
Great ambience. knowledgeable. weight staff. and a great way to end a day.,5,5,5,5,April 17 2024
It was great!! I have been there many times and the business has definitely been revived. With the prices they are charging and how busy they are maybe they could do a bathroom remodel and some updates. I think that would really make a nice touch:),5,5,5,5,April 17 2024
Fantastic place absolutely amazing food and service would highly recommend,5,5,5,5,April 17 2024
Too loud. Food was ok nothing spectacular. Tables are to close to each other. No privacy at all. Way expensive for the service and the food. Caesar Salad didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. I reserved a table to celebrate my birthday and we couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the time as we expected because of the noise.,3,3,3,2,April 17 2024
Golden Steer is a Vegas classic. As a local its always my preferred steak house.,5,5,5,5,April 17 2024
From the service to the ambience to the food our entire expected was amazing. We had an iconic restaurant experience. We will definitely be back!,5,5,5,5,April 16 2024
What a wonderful meal. longhorn steak and lobster along with one of the best Cesar salads I‚Äôve ever had it‚Äôs just like Caesar Cardini restaurant in Tijuana. What a fantastic way to celebrate your 55th anniversary,5,5,5,5,April 16 2024
It‚Äôs an incredible experience. The food is so delicious. The staff are so well organised and more together like a dance troop. This is my favourite steak restaurant in vegas,5,5,5,5,April 16 2024
First time customers. Will come back for sure! The entire experience was great. the food. service. atmosphere. even the other customers. Loved the table side Caesar salad. the best! We had the New York Steak and lobster tail platter for two. plus sides of mushrooms and baked potato with all the fixings. Good cocktails too.,5,5,5,5,April 16 2024
Absolutely worth the hype and wait for our 2 month out reservation! Everything was absolutely amazing!! Food and service!!! Cream corn and banana fosters is a MUST!!!,5,5,5,5,April 16 2024
Simply put. This place is well worth the money. Service was top tier and the food was even better! Highly recommend! The entire staff was so friendly and patient. Showed us around the entire restaurant. What a wonderful time. Thank you so much!,5,5,5,5,April 15 2024
My favorite Restaurant.  Never had a bad meal. service is fantastic. Pricy. but you get what you pay for.,5,5,5,5,April 14 2024
"""I love the relaxed feel of this place ‚Äì like a comfortable dining room in a friends home. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The potato-leek soup was amazing and the Bibb lettuce salad was refreshing. The table was split on the monkfish ‚Äì one person thought it was great. but another felt that the tastes didn't quite mesh. Everyone loved the flat iron steak. Service was well-timed and friendly. wines were affordable.""",5,5,5,5,April 13 2024
The steak was under cook I ask for medium well and it came to the table medium rare and it was just ok I think for the price the food could have been a lot better.,1,1,1,1,April 13 2024
Great service! Good food! Definitely worth the trip!,5,4,5,5,April 12 2024
Too expensive and slow service. Not worth the $250 per person that we paid.,3,5,3,4,April 12 2024
Love it! A Vegas staple. Got lucky with a reservation. SO good!,5,5,5,5,April 12 2024
We ordered the Tomahawk. and with a large potato and table side Cesar salad. it was a perfect meal that three could share. The meat is top notch. full of flavor and tender. We also had the twice baked potato. which is very good but a little smaller. For dessert. we ordered the table side cherries jubilee. which surprisingly was not as sweet as we thought it would be and went quite well with the bowl of vanilla ice cream! Good spot to ride share to as parking is limited in the small lot. but it is just right off the strip at Sahara.,5,5,5,5,April 12 2024
Terrific food. service and a wonderful atmosphere,5,5,5,5,April 12 2024
Service and food was amazing!!!! Bday surprise was a success.,5,5,5,5,April 11 2024
This is the best meal I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Ali was our server and he was fantastic.,5,5,5,5,April 11 2024
We booked here for a birthday dinner months before we had even left Australia.  The food was great. and the atmosphere was fantastic.  We even got to sit in the Elvis Presley Booth which was a huge buzz for me.,4,4,4,5,April 11 2024
The ambiance was just something else. A hard reservation to get but totally worth it. Cocktails were incredible(and I‚Äôm judgy. I‚Äôm a bartender). We got the oysters rockefeller and they were delicious. We got the table side Caesars salad. best I ever had. I don‚Äôt even normally order salads and I ate every bite. She got a petite filet. cooked to perfection. Me‚Ä¶the NY. again cooked to perfection. May‚Äôve been the best steak I‚Äôve ever had. That crust was just something else. We shared a giant lobster tail‚Ä¶.again they killed it. It was my birthday so they gave me a slice of cheesecake. Lightest and fluffiest cheesecake I‚Äôve ever had. Was incredible. Service was impeccable too. If you can get in. can‚Äôt recommend this place enough,5,5,5,5,April 11 2024
On the Open Table app on your phone. it allows for them to notify you once something comes available. Those go extremely fast. so you have to be a ninja clicker. It is very hard to get reservations here. We got in last minute. hostess with heart-shaped glasses was a doll. We tipped her. At the table. Ali greeted us first. He explained how a group of them would be servicing us. Ali is a who we remembered. Tableside Caesar was good but holy smokes- WAY too much raw garlic. It was all we could taste. Even a day later. Ug. Not many kisses this night. Petite filet devoured. chicken parm good and cheesy. side of bourdeux mushrooms good and salty. French fries different. delicious but needed a much harder fry. as they were limp.:/ Cocktails were top notch. Service was fantastic. Their schtick/storytelling was so rehearsed and repetitive that it seemed fake. Please show some respect- DO NOT show up in casual clothes. Put on something nice and stop acting important. This is the most famous steakhouse in Vegas. Put on a nice shirt and shoes. Save the sweatsuit for your next dinner date/club. A Cab was very easy to get once we left.,3,3,5,5,April 11 2024
Absolutely hands down best steak. drinks and service in Las Vegas.  I‚Äôve eaten at many high need restaurants in Vegas and this is hands down the best you‚Äôll experience.  We will be back.,5,5,5,5,April 11 2024
The food & service were excellent! Will definitely be visiting again. Keep in mind reservations are months out so book it now!,5,5,5,5,April 10 2024
Please order the table side Caesar! Salmon was delicious. Glad we went back.,5,5,5,5,April 10 2024
It was my wife a nice 30th wedding anniversary. We had a fantastic time and a great meal. Everybody was friendly and knowledgeable.,5,5,5,5,April 10 2024
Definitely worth the wait. While the parking situation and general entrance to get to this place could (should) be better for a historic landmark such as this. it was a great meal. The entrance/bar area is definitely too small for as busy as this place gets. As we were waiting for our reservation. it felt overcrowded with so many of us waiting. Other than that. everyone and everything was fantastic!,5,5,5,5,April 10 2024
It was our 5th anniversary. and we loved sharing it with the Golden Steer and staff! Everyone was so polite and top notch!!  You made it a joyous and wonderful!  Thank you again!!  See you next year for our 6th Anniversary!,5,5,5,5,April 10 2024
Seated quickly and even our orders were taken promptly but that's where the service really ended. Once we got our food. we were never checked on again. They never came to refill drinks. The lobster was over cooked. dry and had a bitter taste. The butter for the lobster had almost no taste to it. We were extremely dissapointed. Steak was good as was the Caesar salad.,3,3,3,4,April 10 2024
My steak was the BEST EVER!!!! But being from Michigan my mash wasn‚Äôt mashing my. Broccoli was horrible ü•¥,5,4,5,5,April 9 2024
The service was impeccable.  Kudos to the staff!  My husband really liked his T-bone.   That says a lot since he regularly sends back his steak if not cooked right.  My filet had some chewy bits in there but otherwise the right temperature.  The mushroom burgundy was way too salty. but the creamy potato was perfect.  The restaurant stresses their dress code. but we witnessed some really scantily dressed folks who walked in.   Overall. it's an experience that's worth trying once but we won't be back as there are just so many places with better overall food and ambience.,4,4,5,3,April 9 2024
The service was outstanding. Our servers were just amazing.  the table side  salad was probably one of the best things i have had. The main itself was below average. The salmon was tasteless and my steak just awful. Probably would never go back there again. But service is outstanding.,1,1,5,5,April 9 2024
The place was iconic. The food was incredible and the atmosphere and service is top notch.,5,5,5,5,April 9 2024
Great food. great service. great overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed everything from start to end. We will return next time we are in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,April 8 2024
The best steak and Caesar Saladüëåüèº Great service and the ambience is amazing.,5,5,5,5,April 8 2024
The food was very good but we've had better for much less money. The atmosphere is elegant and the service spot on . The cocktails are also very good. I found that the value for us wasn't there. Our bill with a nice tip was over 400.00,4,3,5,4,April 8 2024
Absolutely wonderful. Limited parking but available,5,5,5,5,April 8 2024
Wonderful dining experience. Food and service were fantastic! So glad we went!,5,5,5,5,April 8 2024
One of the best places to eat.  High recommend the table side Cesar salad.  Great service.,5,5,5,5,April 8 2024
Freaking awesome from start to finish. Now I know why they have been around since 1958,5,5,5,5,April 8 2024
Not worth the price. all hype. Could get much better quality and value on the strip as crazy as it sounds,3,2,4,4,April 7 2024
Very nostalgic. great vibe. fun place to visit great food.,5,5,5,5,April 7 2024
Outstanding as always. Corey our waiter and his back waiters were great.,5,5,5,5,April 6 2024
Table side Caesar salad and Cherries Jubilee are a must. Service was great and the atmosphere was incredible.,5,5,5,5,April 6 2024
Outstanding!,5,5,5,5,April 6 2024
an expensive but good meal. as usual. we do like Golden Steer. I think I like the Cesar salad presentation the best.,5,5,4,5,April 5 2024
This was no question the best restaurant I've ever been to in my life. Take your lady here! Food is amazing. service is top notch. It's like stepping back in time to when people were just much classier. Will definitely come back here.,5,5,5,5,April 5 2024
Service was outstanding and the food was excellent,5,5,5,5,April 4 2024
The location & history is unmatched! Service was really good just got slow at the end looking for our server to pay/asking for drink refills. The food and presentations make the meal a full experience. Definitely a must do.,4,5,4,5,April 4 2024
Golden Steer is the best restaurant in Vegas. and that is saying a lot.  My wife and I have traveled the world and whenever we‚Äôre in Vegas we always dine at the Golden Steer.  The food is fantastic as is the service. wine list and  ambiance!  If you can get in. consider yourself lucky!,5,5,5,5,April 4 2024
Celebrating my daughter's birthday was one of the highlights of our Girls Trip and we thank the good Lord for enabling us to get a reservation!  THANK YOU FOR MAKING HER DAY SPECIAL!!!,5,5,5,5,April 3 2024
Truly a once in a lifetime experience. Everything about the Golden Steer was amazing,5,5,5,5,April 3 2024
Recently came in for our anniversary with some friends. and I am still thinking about just how awesome that dinner was. The feel of the restaurant is very organic. and authentic. The staff are all courteous. and quick to attend to any requests we had. All of the kindness felt very genuine. Portions were all made quite perfect. The appetizers were on point. but the main reason for this review was the steaks. Out of this world good. The table had multiple Filets. and Ribeye steaks brought. all perfectly cooked. amazing crust. tender and flavorful to the last bite. Worth every penny. and has me that much more excited for our next visit. Last but not least. the desserts. We got both cheesecakes. and some cr√®me brule. Consistency is always key on both of these items. and they knocked them out of the park. Everyone at our table left full. happy. and I can‚Äôt thank you guys enough for that. You made our anniversary perfect.,5,5,5,5,April 3 2024
We made reservations two months out. Looked at the menu a dozen times before ever even going. knew what we were having without looking at the menu. It‚Äôs was the best meal we‚Äôve had in Vegas. The total experience was all we expected and will add it to our must go to restaurants on our yearly Vegas trips,5,5,5,5,April 3 2024
We got the table side Caesar salad. They put a lot of garlic in it. I had to ask for 75% of the garlic to be taken out. The Caesar salad has a very bold strong anchovy and acidic flavor. The bread crumbs were hard as a rock. There are other salads that looked a LOT better at other tables. We also ordered the petite filet mignon and lobster tail special. It was fantastic. The baked potato and cream spinach was also very good. The bananas foster was good. but not the best dessert; table side experience was fun though.,5,5,5,5,April 1 2024
Celebrated my husbands 50th birthday here. We had a wonderful experience. great service and excellent food.,5,5,5,5,April 1 2024
So good!!! Will be back soon.  Great service. great food. great location.  My steak was perfect!,5,5,5,5,April 1 2024
I have been to several restaurants in Las Vegas. and the Golden Steer is the best by far!!,5,5,5,5,March 31 2024
Atmosphere. service. and food were all exceptional!,5,5,5,5,March 31 2024
The table made Caesar salad and bananas foster were amazing. Golden Steer is a must for us anytime we are in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,March 31 2024
Love this place and the food was very delicious!!!!!,5,5,5,5,March 31 2024
Great food and service - the ambiance was an added bonus.,5,5,5,5,March 31 2024
This is my best place to eat by far! Can‚Äôt get enough of their steak & lobster. Not to mention they have an Amazing Old Fashioned!!!,5,5,5,5,March 30 2024
The service was great.   We did the Longhorn & lobster tail.  It was really good but not a $250/meal.    I wouldn't go again but it was good.,5,5,5,5,March 30 2024
Food and service was exceptional. Every bit as advertised. The ambiance was great. An old-time rustic ambiance with red leather and lots of dark wood. We had one main server. and then he had like 4 people working with him. Never an empty glass nor a dirty dish lasted long with out attending to. Steaks were cooked to perfection and the flavor was excellent. Server recommended the cr√®me br√ªlee over the chocolate cake for desert. and it was the best we‚Äôve ever had. The carajillo desert drink was phenomenal as well.,5,5,5,5,March 30 2024
Great service. We tried getting reservations and they were booked and left a message and received a personal call back each time. The food. service. atmosphere... everything was  exploratory. Thank you for the best. most amazing experience we have had.,5,5,5,5,March 29 2024
As advertised. The food was great . Service was good . We will go back and just try to order less because of the cost,5,5,5,5,March 29 2024
Amazing! Food. service. drinks ‚Ä¶ it was all incredible. Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,March 29 2024
Great food and service. Wait staff is very professional and always paying attention. Anything you need they will take care of it for you.,5,5,5,5,March 29 2024
The table-side Caesar salad is a must. It's as much a show as it is delightful to eat. The service was quick and perfectly timed. And the lobster. filet. and twice baked potato were to die for. Lovely old school steakhouse decor. the booths offer the best seating. 10/10 recommend,5,5,5,5,March 28 2024
I Absolutely loved it!! I came all the way from CHICAGO!!! Not only was everything and everyone was amazing a Nice older gentleman paid for my meal !!!! Wow what a great time ! Thank you guys see you in the future ! .. RO,5,5,5,5,March 28 2024
One of the best steakhouses in Las Vegas. This was truly quite the experience. My partner and I wound up spending over $500 though on dinner and drinks üòÖ which was unexpected but beside that there‚Äôs nothing I wouldn‚Äôt order again!,5,5,5,5,March 28 2024
Great experience. service was very attentive. Table side salad was a must and delicious. Steak was perfectly prepared and the lobster tail was humongous! Will return!,5,5,5,5,March 28 2024
Was expecting more for what we paid for it. Great atmosphere. the table side salad was great but steak was average.  Maybe it was too hyped up to me prior to the visit but I was hoping for more.,3,3,5,5,March 27 2024
A spot that truly lives up to the hype and expectations. Old school in the best kind of way. service that‚Äôs friendly but professional.  Never felt ignored. timing on service was and courses was impeccable. and the quality of products was fantastic.,5,5,5,5,March 27 2024
Waited three months to be able book a table.Upon arrival greeted by a courteous maitre d . and seated in the ‚ÄòJohn Wayne‚Äô booth. which is in short distance from front door so is draughty. And has other customers hanging around waiting for seating . Attended to by a dour and aloof server.Ordered.my steak arrived and cooked ok medium rare but covered in the house butter that masked its taste.Wife had ordered a chicken Caesar salad. and by the time the server had messed about preparing it at the table. the sides were cold.Server non plus. Fries the worst I‚Äôve ever had.steak average. but asparagus excellent.Dont believe the hype.much better elsewhere.,2,2,2,2,March 27 2024
The staff was so professional and attentive.  Food was all ordered at once but spaced out perfectly.  The filet with the garlic butter and the blackened salmon were phenomenal.  The prices were a little high but quality of food and service made it worth it.  A perfect date night,5,5,5,5,March 27 2024
Amazing experience at the Legendary Golden Steer steakhouse! Arrived about 10 min early for reservation and had a quick cocktail at the bar before heading to the ‚ÄúDean Martin‚Äù booth. Our servers Spencer and David were awesome and shared some Vegas history with us. The table side Caesar salad was unbelievably good. The steaks were cooked perfect and had great flavor. The crab legs were sweet and the lobster tail was bigger than the plate. Had the bananas foster table side service for desert. Also exceptional. Definitely a Vegas must do!!,5,5,5,5,March 26 2024
Great food. great service and great atmosphere. We eat at the Golden Steer every time we are in Vegas. LOVE IT!!!,5,5,5,5,March 26 2024
It was definitely worth the wait! From the time you get checked in to the time you leave. It was fantastic! The ambience was perfect! The staff was truly incredible. Each person took the time to get to know us. The caesar salad was delicious. We ordered the chicken parm and petite filet mignon. It was cooked to perfection. The twice baked potato was just ok. Nothing great! But the presentation of the banana fosters was the topping! Loved every single second of it.,5,5,5,5,March 25 2024
Wonderful food. service. and atmosphere. Iconic and lives up to its reputation. If you are in Vegas. this is a must!,5,5,5,5,March 25 2024
This place absolutely is worth the hype. if I can get a reservation. I keep coming back,5,5,5,5,March 25 2024
Food and overall ambiance was great. However. at the end of our meal the server tipped over water and it got all over me. Not happy about that at all. But overall. despite this happening. I would probably go back.,4,5,3,4,March 24 2024
Great food. Service was amazing. Never had to ask for refills on drinks. Must get Caesar salad and banana foster.,5,5,5,5,March 24 2024
We waited four months for a reservation at Golden Steer. The hostess was great and seated us quickly. The food was very good. The service was pretty good. There are several servers working each table. The good came out very fast but the drinks were slow. Definitely worth the experience. but pricey compared to other steakhouses in Vegas.,4,4,4,4,March 24 2024
We were there for our 38th wedding anniversary. Immediately we felt uncomfortable with the members of  another big table next to us. Loud and searching for a phone they lost. I mean the dinner came I‚Äôm eating I look up and the guy next to us had his butt in our face for five minutes searching for that damn phone.   We enjoyed the service but got the shaft on seating. Hard to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be back.‚Äù,2,4,4,5,March 23 2024
We eat here every year for our March madness trip ! Our favorite place to eat in Vegas !,5,5,5,5,March 23 2024
Excellent meal. Caesar salad fantastic. Lobster as advertised. Service great. Everyone friendly.,5,5,5,4,March 22 2024
First time at the restaurant! My wife and I were blown away with the level of service and food! 100% will come back next time in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,March 22 2024
TABLE OF 8. AND A $2K TAB. ONLY ALLOWED 90 MIN?  I made reservations months prior for a friends birthday and was shocked to be told. while being seated. that we had to be out of our seats within 90 minutes. We were early for our reservation so this was a bit confusing to me. Aren‚Äôt 8 tops allowed 2 hours?  I have been coming here for years. spending thousands of $$ at a time.  Whether it be with family. friends or client dinners I have always had impeccable service. Not once felt rushed. Is this the new regime here at the GS? If so. count me out.,3,5,2,4,March 22 2024
We loved everything about Golden Steer.  The service was very good.  The lobster was delicious and the sides were great.  The Caesar salad was special!!  The steak we had was average so would go back but only for the lobster.  My husband and I did dinner for 2 for $250.  There was way too much food.  We had our daughters and we could have split it 4 ways.  Like I said. everything was so good but not our Longhorn steak. which was disappointing.  Check that off our bucket list,5,4,5,5,March 22 2024
This restaurant is amazing! We loved every part of our dining experience! The food was spectacular and the service was on point! Great vibes from the customers!,5,5,5,5,March 21 2024
The service is wonderful.   The food is good but very pricey for what you get.,5,4,5,5,March 21 2024
I have no words to describe how great the golden steer is.  From the service of carlos to the table side Caesar salad to the perfectly cooked and seasoned steaks.  Absolutely a must!  Oh. did i mention the cherries jubilee??  üòã,5,5,5,5,March 20 2024
This is one of our favorite places to eat. We celebrated our 24th Anniversary here back in March and we would definitely come back again. The Food and Service was amazing!!,5,5,5,5,March 20 2024
Frank Sinatra both and everything was spectacular.,5,5,5,5,March 20 2024
Excellent service as usual. The place is always busy. but they do a great job handling that and still giving everyone that personalized service.,5,5,5,5,March 20 2024
The Golden Steer has been a bucket list restaurant for some time. It didn't disappoint. When you walk in you are immediately taken care of in the old school atmosphere. with dark wood and and red booths. You can almost see the Rat Pack sitting there. The food was good. close to great. I had a Crab Cocktail my wife a Wedge. Both were good. I had a small filet and she had prime rib. The filet was over cooked for medium but still good. The whole experience was fantastic. I would recommend it for the whole experience.,4,4,5,5,March 20 2024
Amazing food and atmosphere. Outside looks sketchy but inside is beautiful,5,5,5,5,March 20 2024
Hard to get a reservation but worth trying. The 18-20 seat bar is open seating. IMO top items in order. 1. Table side Caesar Salad 2. French onion soup 3. Any steak. 4. Finish with table side cherry jubilee. Wait staff is pleasant and always on point. This is a steak house. sea bass is not up to the standard of the steaks!  However. tough to beat the quality of steak. The seasoning is outstanding.,5,5,5,5,March 20 2024
Had a great experience and will be back soon. Really recommend this place,5,5,5,5,March 19 2024
A little overrated to me.  We had reservations and our party was on time but we still had to stand waiting approximately 40 minutes for our table. They gave us complimentary meatballs for our wait.  Our steaks were good. not great.  I have had much better with great presentation at Steak Market. Glad I went though.  At least I know I‚Äôm not missing anything.,4,4,5,4,March 19 2024
The service was amazing and the food was so delicious and the ambience had a lot of history and it is a dinner and a show and the best possible way,5,4,5,5,March 19 2024
Excellent steak .  excellent lobster .Ôøº every time I go to Vegas.  it‚Äôs one of my favorites steak place.,5,5,5,5,March 19 2024
We enjoyed our meal. A little overrated. Our bill for 2 was $515.00. Two cocktails. No appetizers. no sides. no dessert. Market price for Lobster Tails $105.00.,4,4,5,4,March 19 2024
Amazing food. best steak I have ever had! Rare 12oz Filet with the butter! Sides were plenty to split between 3 - 4 people. Had Twice baked. Mac & cheese. and broccoli. Salmon was good. came with veggies-not great. but better than average. The table side Caesar salad was a fun addition. The gentleman preparing it gave a great history of the restaurant and a little Vegas history. The garlic bread is good and definitely worth the $6. The bananas foster was amazing. and the strawberry cheesecake was great! The strawberries that were in lused with the cheesecake were huge!  Overall. great dining experience. One note. for large parties over 6 it is an 18% auto-gratuity and one check per table. However. they will take multiple cards.  Side note. we had the same entrees at Hells Kitchen the night before. and this was 100x better!,5,5,5,5,March 18 2024
Best meal experience we have ever had!  The atmosphere. the service. and the food. are second to none!,5,5,5,5,March 18 2024
One of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. The staff was super friendly and informative about the food and the restaurant. The food was far superior to any other steakhouse I‚Äôve ever eaten at. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be returning in the future! It was a great way to celebrate my birthday!,5,5,5,5,March 17 2024
An amazing dining experience all around! The service. food and ambiance were all incredible. Highly recommended.,5,5,5,5,March 16 2024
We had a wonderful time eating at Golden Steer. The superb staff and great appetizers along with the ambiance and indulging steak and lobster entrees. The best eating experience with friends.,5,5,5,5,March 16 2024
Our experience started with a very crowded bar area. We ordered two drinks; an old fashioned and a Moscow mule. Both were not that good. I wanted to return them but my bf said no let‚Äôs just order something different when we eat. We ordered two appetizers; the shrimp and oysters. Both were good. For dinner. the longhorn and lobster for two. the steak had a line of gristle going through it but the lobster was good. We paid extra for sauces that were also mediocre. For our sides. we ordered the whipped potatoes and the sweet cream corn. The potatoes tasted like instant potatoes with no flavor and watered down. The corn was super sweet. not edible. Besides the not so good food. the service was the worst. we were with another couple and the waiter said they couldn‚Äôt give us two bills. We only met the head waiter once at the beginning and then at the end. We had to flag down the other waiter to order more drinks. We spoke to and felt bad for the couple next to us who were just married and were receiving the same poor service. The food and service was definitely not worth the $900 bill for four people. There are better places in Vegas. This is not worth the hype. the overpricing. the taste nor the service.,1,1,2,2,March 16 2024
Again. the Golden Steer was outstanding!  From drinks at the bar while waiting for our table (we were early) to the booth we requested. everything was great and it only got better. The table side Caesar Salad was delicious. the Prime Rib perfect and our Bananas Foster was a definite treat.  It‚Äôs an experience!!,5,5,5,5,March 15 2024
From the moment we stepped in the door it was.Greay. The food was Good.,5,4,5,5,March 14 2024
Delicous and lovely ambiance highly recommend second time going will keep coming back,5,5,5,5,March 14 2024
Party of 6 our meal was flawless. service and food were fantastic,5,5,5,5,March 14 2024
Always a great steak.  Great service and a ton of tradition.,5,5,5,5,March 14 2024
Absolutely delicious!!! Amazing table side experience!!!,5,5,5,5,March 13 2024
We had a very nice evening here. Our reservation was for 9:00 and we were seated by 9:15. The sommelier was a super pro and the team that worked our table was great. Our server was a little green but he was nice and working on his technique. The lobster tail was an 8/10. A little dry. but still very flavorful. At $109 a tail. I did expect a little more precision in the cooking; someone came out while we were halfway through our salads to ask if we were ready for our lobster. When we said no. perhaps they went under a heat lamp? The macaroni and cheese was tasty and the wedge salad was just okay. When our server asked if we‚Äôd like regular ice or a big cube in our bourbon. we were a little surprised that the ‚Äúbig cube‚Äù was a $2 up charge. Still. a very good dinner. very nice staff. and a very lovely experience. I would go back and give it another chance.,4,4,4,5,March 13 2024
Loved this place definitely worth the wait! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,March 13 2024
This is an absolutely amazing steakhouse. the service and food was phenomenal ambiance was classic old school vibes. but with that comes with the expense. you better bring your first born. We had a table for 2 and we had the Cesar salad for two which was excellent and we had no appetizers or sides. we both had the lobster tail and the 24oz ribeye which was unbelievable and 4 drinks üçπ Total amount with tip $707 pretty crazy.,5,5,5,5,March 13 2024
Excellent as always.  Already booked for September.,5,5,5,4,March 13 2024
The Golden Steer is a MUST for the total Vegas experience! The experience is SUPERIOR at every level.,5,5,5,5,March 13 2024
Loved everything. Was a bit steep. but amazing all at the same time.,5,5,5,5,March 13 2024
Wonderful dining experience! Ordered dinner for two and couldn‚Äôt eat half of it. Wanted to try dessert but too full. Lovely cocktails.,5,4,5,5,March 13 2024
Service was under-whelming. steak and lobster were fantastic the mashed potato side was small and just ok.  Really thought the service tools have been over-the-top. but it wasn‚Äôt  We would go again‚Ä¶,4,4,3,5,March 12 2024
Amazing food! Amazing service! Staff were nice from the moment we walked into the door! Will visit again!,5,5,5,5,March 12 2024
Well worth the wait. The food was excellent. The service was amazing. Everyone was friendly and courteous. The quality of the food matches no other in Las Vegas. I had the Australian Lobster and Tomahawk Steak. Delicious!,5,5,5,5,March 12 2024
Food was great! Service was great. ambience was great!,5,5,5,5,March 12 2024
Everything was amazing! Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Everyone needs to try this place.,5,5,5,5,March 12 2024
Old and famous. this restuarant now rests more on their history and laurels than their quality in food. We have heard from locals that they are fairly inconsistent. Some days have great steak and some have terrible. overcooked meats. Unfortunately. while our steak that day was fantastic. the seafood and $100+ giant lobster tail was overcooked and generally flavorless. We were so looking forward to it. too.   For a meal as exspensive as it was in a place as beautiful as it is. everything should be good all the time. not a constant hit or miss. The appetizers and sides we got were very unremarkable and the whipped potatos seemed like they had been sitting out for a while because they had that dull sheen/skin over the top of them..  I can at least say that the cesar salad was the best we've ever had and this seems to be the only consistent item across the board. The history of the place also makes it novel and fun. We would never go back for the food. as there are much better steakhouses in the city.,2,2,3,5,March 12 2024
Everything was fantastic. Don‚Äôt feel the need to dress up. but this place is amazing. Worth it!,5,5,5,5,March 11 2024
We were there for a 21st birthday and everything was professional. amazing and one of the best dinning experiences ever. We were seated at the Frank Sinatra table which was such an honor.,5,5,5,5,March 11 2024
Amazing food and service. Great place to celebrate,5,5,5,5,March 11 2024
Great experience!  Atmosphere takes diners back to 1958 with the nostalgic atmosphere.  Service was excellent!  Needs were anticipated and met.   The shorthand steaks (NY strip 16 ounces) was the best steak I have ever had!  The shrimp cocktail was so delicious!  We all loved the cocktail sauce.,5,5,5,5,March 10 2024
"To be ""so iconic"" it was very lacking. The food was nothing I would come back for. The sides were extremely disappointing and though my filet was good...no one else raved about their steaks or salmon. The Cesars salad was not the best I've had before.  Service was not attentive like other high end steak houses. 4 people $700. You can do better. Come on.",2,2,1,1,March 10 2024
Seated right on time. Food quality great as always. The time to get our food took way too long this past Saturday night. Between out appetizer and the Cesar salad. was over an hr. The issue was noted. the the appetizer was comped. but regardless it significantly impacted our plans.,4,5,4,5,March 10 2024
Amazing and iconic! Outstanding food and service in such a great atmosphere.,5,5,5,5,March 10 2024
We had another great visit to the Steer.  Tableside Caesar and Bananas Foster were impeccable as always.  The Ribeye was a tad undercooked but was still wonderful.,5,4,5,5,March 9 2024
Celebrate our anniversary there every year. Always delicious with the best service!,5,5,5,5,March 9 2024
Great server! Food was outstanding. Great experience! Recommend everyone check it out!,5,5,5,5,March 9 2024
This is a historical place. The food was good.  Prices are high.  However - there are several steak houses in vegas that have great steaks - great service and are well worth the experience.  This is fun to check off your list - but it does not live up to the hype.  Still enjoyable.,4,4,4,4,March 8 2024
We had the lobster.petit filet and crab legs as well as twice baked potatoe and table side Caesar salad.  All were delicious. will definitely return next time in Vegas.  Service was spot on. there when you needed something but not all over you.,5,5,5,5,March 8 2024
Such an awesome spot! Well worth the cost for the service alone. Can‚Äôt wait for next time.,5,5,5,5,March 8 2024
Steak was good.  Lobster was average.  Overpriced for what it is.  Service was spectacular.  Caesar salad incredible.,3,3,5,5,March 8 2024
Not quite as good as usual. but still excellent. The service and ambience definitely makes up for the food being a little less than perfect this time. I will definitely go again.,4,4,5,5,March 8 2024
First time at this location. we were very well taken care of and the food was top notch. Will definitely be dining here again the next time I‚Äôm in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,March 7 2024
Staff was awesome from start to finish. Reserved for a party of 9 and was given a private room (didn‚Äôt know they had one) but it was perfect for my dad‚Äôs birthday celebration. Multiple waiters that were very attentive and our main waiter (I‚Äôm sorry I forgot his name) was exceptional. He gave great recommendations on wine! Most of use ordered the Rib Eye steak. no regrets there! We all had side caesar salad which was prepared table side and it was just the right amount of food with a few side dishes. We were the last group to leave. felt bad we didn‚Äôt even know they were closing since we were in a private room but they did not make up feel rushed at all. Will definitely return next time we‚Äôre in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,March 7 2024
This Restaurant has style and MANNERS! We had to wait about 20mins for our dinner reservation to be seated but totally understood. when we were seated we were seat Joey Bishop's Booth. One of the best seats in the place. It was our 21st Anniversary so we went all out ordered the longhorn and lobster. escargot. meatballs. and their famous Ceasar salad and worth every penny. Best dinner we have ever had. And since it was our anniversary dessert was free and because we had to wait at the beginning they took $20 off our bill to our surprise. Top Notch!,5,5,5,5,March 7 2024
The atmosphere was great and the food was outstanding!,5,5,5,5,March 7 2024
Absolutely amazing. Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Oysters we're tiny. but I'm from California so I might be spoiled. Waiters told stories about the restaurant. Only complaint is the tiny oysters. But that's barely a complaint.,5,5,5,5,March 6 2024
I‚Äôve been coming here for 20 years!  Never miss it when I‚Äôm in town.,5,5,5,5,March 6 2024
Have had this place on a semi bucket list idea it was everything I expected and more great service great food great atmosphere. but let me circle back to the service. It was top-notch every single person that we encountered. went above.,5,5,5,5,March 6 2024
Absolutely a fantastic meal    There is a reason reservations are hard to make,5,5,5,5,March 6 2024
Top steak house in the world!!! This restaurant is everything I thought it would be and more. Food and service is second to none!!! Great history and worthy of all the buzz!!! Everyone must dine here at least once in there life for the experience and every time thereafter while in Las Vegas. Be sure to make reservations months in advance!!!,5,5,5,5,March 6 2024
Our meal and service was superb!  We had steak and lobster and the lobster was HUGE.  Probably could have gone with one or the other.  The atmosphere was that of years ago. dark wood. low lighting reminding us of the early days of Vegas!  Very quaint. The service was perfect and we were very happy with our visit!!,5,5,5,5,March 6 2024
Great ambience.  The service was on point.  James was great!,5,5,5,5,March 5 2024
People should be aware that the restaurant is very pricey. so expectations can be set accordingly. I am a person who will likely only be able to visit The Golden Steer once in my lifetime. Having said that. I regret not a penny of it. The Golden Steer is a special experience that will stand out as a spectacular memory. The food was exquisite. Absolutely 100% delectable. The service was impeccable. We were greeted. helped. served. checked on by several people. with kindness and attention to detail and warmth. They‚Äôre not snobby üòâ If you like classic. old time Vegas. you will find it here. And If you are lucky enough to have an occasion to mark a special day. The Golden Steer is a great place to do it.,5,5,5,5,March 5 2024
Loved it and so did my guests. the history the food and the service 100/10,5,5,5,5,March 4 2024
The food was amazing each course was delicious.  The waiters were very friendly and attentive and nice birthday experience.,5,5,5,5,March 4 2024
The food was amazing and staff were prompt. courteous and freindly.,5,5,5,5,March 4 2024
food was amazing. we ordered the longhorn steak and the prime rib. split between 2 people each. as well as the loaded twice baked potato which was a little oniony but worth it. dessert was so worth it. we got the birthday cheesecake slice and a tiramisu and the All Shook Up after dinner drink was delcious!,5,5,5,5,March 4 2024
This is a GREAT steakhouse! Everything from the tableside caesar salad presentation to the steak amd lobster was EXCELLENT! The drinks were tasty too!,5,5,5,5,March 4 2024
We were the first couple to be seated in the back room but for some reason the last to be served,4,4,4,4,March 4 2024
Awesome place! Food and service is amazing! Our third time visiting and we can‚Äôt wait to be back!,5,5,5,5,March 3 2024
Best steakhouse in Las Vegas! Hands-down Golden Steer. Best customer service. best food and drinks. It was a wonderful birthday treat for me. ‚ô•Ô∏è,5,5,5,5,March 3 2024
First time at Golden Steer and what an amazing date night we had. Definitely going back,5,5,5,5,March 3 2024
Great overall experience and the food was fantastic.,5,5,5,5,March 3 2024
Very good service. food was amazing except the veggies were ok. We got the broccoli and it was nothing special but loved the burgundy mushrooms. Steak was fabulous!,5,4,5,5,March 3 2024
"Great ""Old Vegas"" vibe.  The steaks were delicious and flavorful.  The sides were also good.  I wouldn't recommend the calamari.  It was super chewy and not tender.  The service was also a bit slow.  Overall. we enjoyed our meal there and would go back again.",4,4,3,4,March 2 2024
Great times with great friends! Service was great from the start and lasted throughout. The food was amazing. just pricey.,5,4,5,5,March 2 2024
Best place to eat in Las Vegas.  Never disappoints.,5,5,5,5,March 1 2024
We visit Las Vegas twice a year and Golden Steer Steakhouse has become a tradition that I look forward to. The most wonderful and attentive staff. steak to die for. and everyone must try their table made Caesar Salad & dessert of bananas foster.,5,5,5,5,March 1 2024
Food was delicious and our waiter went above and beyond to make sure our food was delicious,5,5,5,5,February 29 2024
What can you say? I‚Äôm glad I got lucky and was able to get a reservation  quicker than the 3 1/2-4 month wait because this place is awesome. If you want a quintessential Vegas experience this is the place for you. The food and service is fabulous and top notch!!,5,5,5,5,February 29 2024
Excellent service.   Top notch.   It‚Äôs my second time there and my fianc√© 1st time we came and celebrated our engagement.   ÔøºServed us a  surprise cheesecake which was delicious.   Also had enough leftovers for another meal.  #1 restaurant in vegas in my book.,5,5,5,5,February 29 2024
We had an 8pm reservation. We weren‚Äôt seated until around 8:45 but that was explained when we checked in. Apparently a power outage from the night before so they were trying to squeeze in some reservations from the night before. For as long as it takes to get a reservation here. I completely understood. If ours was cancelled and moved to the next night under those circumstances I‚Äôd be plenty happy so we were very understanding. Now. they did make this up to us by bringing us a few complementary items.  We started with a table side Caesar salad. It was perfection as always. It never lets down and I get it to start every time. One person in our party of four got the French onion soup. She said it was great. Next they brought out the butchers cut meatballs. Good size and so flavorful. These were a complementary item brought to us for our long wait. I‚Äôd order these next time I visit as an appetizer for sure. My wife ordered the eggplant parm and she was also given a side of the toasted ravioli. She loved the eggplant parm and said the raviolis were pretty good. One of my friends ordered the chicken parm and said it was one of the best he‚Äôs ever had. Myself and one other friend ordered the ribeye. Both had it cooked medium rare and it was perfectly medium rare. Tons of flavor! I‚Äôve ordered the ribeye every time I‚Äôve come here and it‚Äôs always a great choice. We had the whipped potatoes as a side and also the garlic Parmesan broccoli. The potatoes were so creamy and full of flavor. The broccoli was pretty good. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd order the broccoli again but it wasn‚Äôt bad. just not worth getting again. I‚Äôd go back to the asparagus like I normally get. We capped it off with a table side bananas foster and a Spumoni Bomba. Both were amazing desserts.  Service. as always was a 200/10. Very attentive. My wine glass never reached empty until I refused a refill. These servers were working their tales off all over the room and were absolutely killing it. We will be back again!,5,5,5,5,February 28 2024
The service (once seated) was excellent! The food was terrific. especially the table side Caesar salad. Only gave it 4 stars due to the high price and my reservation being almost an hour behind before we were seated.,4,5,5,5,February 28 2024
Can‚Äôt wait when in town to get treated to the family.,5,5,5,5,February 28 2024
Fabulous service and delicious food.  So glad to have enjoyed this iconic restaurant after living in Vegas for almost 40 years.  Pricey and difficult to get reservations but well worth it for the experience!,5,5,5,5,February 28 2024
Was the best food we‚Äôve ever had. The Cesar salad OMG the best. Definitely will go again. Make reservations.,5,5,5,5,February 28 2024
Love the golden steer.  Make your rezzie months in advance but well worth the wait.    Bring your wallet it‚Äôs not cheap.   Worth. Every.  Penny.,5,5,5,5,February 28 2024
The electricity abruptly shut off during the start of our meal. Was not able to rebook cause they are booked months out (bar top at 430 the next dayü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). They did comp the salad and drinks we had but that was it. I feel they could have done better as I book these reservations months in advance. Ended up at the Vic and Anthonys as did half of the other restaurant. I know it‚Äôs not their fault but things could‚Äôve been handled better Ôøº,1,3,3,3,February 27 2024
Food and service was excellent.  Would come back again!,5,5,5,5,February 27 2024
Celebrated a birthday and the successful completion of our RnR half marathon on the stip.  The venue was super accommodating as one of the parties was running late.  The service was top notch always checking in on everything and salad table side was extraordinary. Tomahawk was the star of the meal. but everything from the sides to the appetizers were really delicious.  I can't recommend this place more.  I knew how popular this place was that I booked 2 months in advance. Loved it! Such a great place.,5,5,5,5,February 26 2024
Worth it! Put a reservation 6 months in advance. Make sure you put this place on your schedule.,5,5,5,5,February 26 2024
Main entries are outstanding! The service is beyond! The sides are just ok.,5,5,5,5,February 26 2024
Heat food and place to eat at had a good time with family,5,5,5,4,February 25 2024
Excellent service and The food is amazing!!! Cheesecake!!!,5,5,5,5,February 25 2024

Amazing experience from when you walk in the door.  All staff make you feel very special and share stories about the history of the restaurant and its famous visitors over the years.  Well worth the price tag for the whole experience x,5,5,5,5,February 24 2024
This experience was over the top. The history and the food are amazing!,5,5,5,5,February 24 2024
Unfortunately we felt our dining experience here didn't live up to the hype.  We were so looking forward to a fantastic evening to celebrate our Anniversary. but it fell short. Overall the food was good. but my steak came out overdone.  They promptly returned it to the kitchen and promised to make me a new one quickly.  Unfortunately. the new steak came out 9-10 minutes later and was extremely rare. so it was sent back again.    By the time my 3rd steak arrived after another 7-8 minutes (which was really the 2nd one. just cooked more) all of our side dishes were cold and my husband's meal had been eaten ALONE while we waited.  Then I had to eat my dinner alone. with cold sides.  Not the sort of anniversary dinner it should have been. especially for the price. My steak was delicious when it was cooked properly. and the tableside Caesar salad was really good.  Our sides were good (corn and mushrooms) but fairly average steakhouse fare. After the disappointing experience. we did get apologies from a manager. and my steak was removed from the bill - However this doesn't really make up for the fact that both our meals were adversely affected to the point neither of us enjoyed dinner.  And for a $400 dinner. it definitely wasn't worth it!   It's doubtful we'll return here when we're in Vegas next.,3,3,4,4,February 24 2024
Dinner was delicious and the best food we‚Äôve ever had. Carlos and Ian were awesome at waiting on us and answered all our questions.  The manager told me I couldn‚Äôt use my camera light to take pictures and videos so that was a bummer.  This was the only restaurant that banned me from using it.  I was doing it to help support their restaurant but disappointed I got in trouble for it.  Was looking forward to posting better quality videos with my light,5,5,5,5,February 24 2024
Exceptional in every way. It‚Äôs a little expensive but well worth every penny as the portions are enormous. My wife and I got the Longhorn and Lobster Tail for two. and it definitely could‚Äôve fed three.  Oysters Rockefeller and the table side Caesar Salad are a must. The lobster tail was very large and so tender. And I‚Äôm a ribeye man. but the strip was perfectly cooked and so flavorful!  Reservations need to be made a couple of months in advance. but don‚Äôt miss out!,5,5,5,5,February 24 2024
For what we paid. I expected more. The table next to us were literally yelling. The drinks. salad and sides were really good. but to have spent almost $1000 to have lobster that was overcooked and steak that was just okay. not really worth it.,3,3,4,4,February 23 2024
"Waited 15 minutes after reservation time. but this is acceptable.  They would have held my reservation if I had been 15 minutes late.  Nifty phone charger in the cramped waiting area.  Drink refill took an entire course to arrive. but they took it off the bill. Still. had to request it multiple times. ""It's on the way.""  Ceasar salad best we've ever had. Absolute must.  Waiter did the minimum checkpoints. Only. We sat after completing dinner for 20 minutes while he walked by the table ignoring us. Eventually. I moved the plates away to indicate we've waited too long. Brian continued to walk past us without a word.  Most of the entrees course dishes were good. My 77$ strip steak had connective tissue throughout. I had to carve off pieces that were chewable. It wasn't worth 25$.  When I pointed out the errors. he argued with me. Dude. We didn't get the drink. Dude. We sat waiting 20 minutes to clear the table and get dessert!  I SO wanted Bananas Foster. but I was afraid how long that would take.  Left very disappointed in the place. I'm very disappointed. Very.",2,2,1,5,February 23 2024
Possibly the best dinner we‚Äôve ever had. Experience w table side dishes was a 100/10!!! Fantastic!,5,5,4,5,February 23 2024
Incredible experience - service was wonderful. food was delicious. and the atmosphere was amazing. Can't wait to go back! Need to try the dessert that we were too full to order!,5,5,5,5,February 23 2024
First time. Will definitely return. Food and service were exceptional.,5,5,5,5,February 22 2024
The team was very coordinated and complimentary.From Marco giving us a quick history tour of the history of the booths and their famous occupants too Corey Carlos and Rob taking care of us the entire evening - everything was top notch!  Thank you..thank you very much,5,5,5,5,February 22 2024
Hands down the best service. best steak. lobster. everything was perfect!,5,5,5,5,February 22 2024
We had an amazing dinner last night.  They were very friendly and accommodating with a last minute change.  Money well spent and enjoyed every bite.  Just sad we didn‚Äôt have room for dessert!  Next time.,5,5,5,5,February 21 2024
We had to make the reservation months in advance and it was well worth it! Everything was amazing!,5,5,5,5,February 21 2024
The whole experience could not have been better Armando made the best Caesar salad I've ever had in my life right in front of us the steaks were off the charts and Greg fixed our bananas Foster table side for dessert truly a meal of a lifetime Ôøº,5,5,5,5,February 20 2024
The food was absolutely amazing! I had the filet and my husband had the blackened salmon. Creamed corn and whipped potatoes were our side dishes. We also shared the cheesecake which I swear it‚Äôs better than the cheesecakes factory! It took over 2 months to book out but it was well worth it!!,5,5,5,5,February 20 2024
A fantastic experience. Some of the best food you'll ever eat. The service was fantastic. Not the cheapest but a great place for steak lovers.,5,5,5,5,February 20 2024
Delicious dinner! The steaks were amazing. For sides we had the twice baked potato. macaroni and cheese and Caesar salad which were all very good.,5,5,5,5,February 20 2024
What a Great experience! Everyone enjoyed their meal. Wine and desserts were also Amazing.,5,5,5,5,February 20 2024
"Restaurant was lovely. I've been to 3 star michelin restaurants and I feel the service was the same minus the ""stuffyness"" while I love. If I'm ever back this way I will absolutely return and bring friends",5,5,5,5,February 19 2024
Wow!! Amazing service. ambience & food was delish!,5,5,5,5,February 19 2024
Ambience and service were excellent. We dined here for our 11 year wedding anniversary and ordered the dinner for 2 steak and lobster with Parmesan garlic broccoli and twice baked potato. fried calamari for the appetizer and table side Caesar salad. Everything was tasty even though the steak had some inedible pieces (silver skin. tendons. hard fat). Overall. Glad we got to experience the historic Golden Steer!,5,4,5,5,February 19 2024
First time here and we all loved it the food was amazing the whole vibe was nice,5,5,5,5,February 19 2024
Tommy . Carlos and Jed are the best!  Provide exceptional service.,5,5,5,5,February 19 2024
Fantastic from start to finish. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. The ribeye was perfectly cooked and we had served Oscar style which elevated it even more.,5,5,5,5,February 18 2024
Delicious food. great service. well worth the price. Will definitely go back when we visit Vegas. Loved the ambiance as well as the cool history.,5,5,5,5,February 18 2024

First time having dinner and it was out of this world GOOD!! Steak and jumbo lobsters was perfect and so good! I will be back on my next visit to Vegas!! Thank you Golden Steer!!,5,5,5,5,February 16 2024
So loud we could not hear the waiter. We're looking forward to a great steak from the reviews. Very disappointed to have a gristle in my Rib eye and had to throw away over half the steak.,3,2,4,3,February 16 2024
An absolutely outstanding dining experience. Wonderful steak. amazing lobster and exceptional staff.,5,5,5,5,February 16 2024
Great experience in Las Vegas. Excellent to try and see how the Rat Pack dined,4,4,4,4,February 16 2024
Seafood tower to start was great.  did the table side Ceaser which was equally amazing and then the Ribeye for an Entree. which was one of the best steaks I've had in a while.  We ended it with a creme brulee dessert. I highly recommend  it.,5,5,5,5,February 15 2024
Food was amazing! Our server Justin was swamped because it was Valentines Day. Justin and his team really pulled it off! The table side Caesar salad presentation as well as the Bananas Fosters did not disappoint!!! We love the Golden Steer !!!,5,5,5,5,February 15 2024
I cant say enough even for Valentines Day the service was amazing and the food out of this world.,5,5,5,5,February 15 2024
Wow! Can‚Äôt believe all the 4-5 star reviews. the sheep mentality I guess! This place is old and tired. dark. noisy and the low uncomfortable seating and decor needs an upgrade. The bread sucks as well as the rest. escargots were prepared in cheap butter or something tasteless with almost no garlic.fries were creasy and prepared in the same frier as all the other battered fried food wich is a big no no. the porterhouse was a disappointment ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and the final was the overpriced cherry & ice cream desert with a show (flames) prepared at the table but with no flavor . They have a pretty good marketing department but the rest is very disappointing to say at least!!,1,1,1,1,February 15 2024
Wonderful place to eat for the old Vegas feel. Must book reservations far in advance but its definitely worth the wait. The ambiance is really nice with nostalgic paintings. photos and props I recommend it.,5,5,5,4,February 15 2024
Lo mejor de lo mejor. La mejor carne y langosta de las vegas.,5,5,5,5,February 14 2024

Not only was the food incredible but the service was UNMATCHED. You are treated like royalty here! Highly recommend and worth the price!,5,5,5,5,February 13 2024
Simply amazing. I understand the hype now. Everything from appetizers to the dessert was well worth the wait.,5,5,5,5,February 13 2024
Food was amazing. Well worth the cost. Staff is very attentive. Must try when in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,February 13 2024
Great Food Great Service Great Place - Can't wait to come back,5,5,5,5,February 13 2024
Absolutely amazing every time!! Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,February 13 2024
Premier old Vegas steakhouse. Where else would you go?,5,4,5,5,February 11 2024
Best service of any restaurant ever. Steak and seafood quality was better than other steakhouses I have eaten at recently. Very cool old Vegas vibes.,5,5,5,5,February 10 2024
Unlike no other! We had a marvelous Anniversary dinner. The food and service were top notch. We cannot wait to return. Thank you so much!,5,5,5,5,February 10 2024
As usual. an excellent meal in every respect. What‚Äôs great on the menu? Anything and everything.,5,5,5,5,February 10 2024
Very nice! Old school vibe. Food was excellent. A must go if you can get reservations. Book early!,5,5,4,5,February 9 2024
If you can afford it or can even stretch your Las Vegas budget a little bit this could be an experience of a lifetime. The food and service are both so excellent and equally complimentary each other‚Äôs obvious high standards of quality. My son and I shared the tomahawk special and expectations were wildly exceeded. A gentleman name Ryan was pleasant. polite and very knowledgeable (I strongly recommend asking for him!!) a Professional!! Ask him how best cook to cook your steak. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Others like Harmen was perfectly attentive to the serving of the food.  Perhaps one of the more beautiful highlights of the evening was Wendy. Her pride in her work and in all the staff was apparent. She loves what she is able to do for the guests and she genuinely care that all your dining needs are met. Her personality is also radiant and she is a wonderful conversationalist.  Thank you,5,5,5,5,February 9 2024
Experience was great. Service and food was fantastic. One issue; we had a friend meet us there and he was wearing a very nice warmup suit. He was refused entry due to ‚Äúdress code‚Äù while others inside had torn jeans. worn shorts. etc.  Didn‚Äôt really understand that.,5,5,5,3,February 9 2024
So much history. amazing service and food.... very knowledgeable staff and wine sommelier!,5,5,5,5,February 9 2024
The food and ambience are always amazing here!! Tried the cherrys jubilee for dessert this visit! It was so good! We will be getting this every visit now.,5,5,5,5,February 8 2024
If you put golden steer in your gps. I hope you get steered to the wrong location and decide on something else . Ordered an old fashioned which was extremely disappointing. Once we were sat down we were greeted with the same dinner rolls they served the rat pack .uncooked and hard and from the 60s. We ordered meatballs and fried cheese ravioli and when the meatballs came out 2 mins later. we thought oh boy the microwave is in full effect tonight. We were right unfortunately. The table side Caesar salad was nice and the best part of the meal. We also ordered a porterhouse and Mac&cheese which was sincerely the most disappointing part of the entire meal. Tasteless ! It was my birthday and we received a free piece of cake in which we thought this is a nice touch ! Until it ‚Äútouched ‚Äú our lips . All hype just keep it moving !,1,1,2,1,February 7 2024
Best steakhouse I have ever been to. Amazing. I definitely will be going back again.,5,5,5,5,February 7 2024
We had the best experience.  The filet mignon was great. I would highly suggest getting the Caesar salad. It is made fresh in front of you. Our server was great. He even offered a tour of the restaurant and gave us some history behind the different rooms. I would definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
Tremendous dinner. service terrific. ambience was exactly what i was hoping for and exceeding expectations. I would perhaps not order the king crab cocktail next time...sauce was awesome but desert crab was not the freshest.  But alas... a very minor comment. Overall everything else was excellent. We were too full for desert so I wish I saved more room.  Highly recommended to visit for that classic vegas experience.,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
Not worth the hype for the food and service. Much better places to go to,1,3,1,3,February 6 2024
Fabulous experience. terrific food and drinks. Highly recommend!,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
1st Timer at the Golden Steer. My Expectations were very high as so Many folks recommended eating here. and well those Expectations were met. Service was impeccable. food and presentation was totally on par for a place like this. Definitely gunna revisit this restaurant. Make sure ya make a reservation as they are booked months out. and bring the cash. ya gunna need it.,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
Always love dining here!! Everything is always exquisite!!,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
Always the most amazing service and food. Absolutely the best steak house in the world.,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
We were celebrating my husband‚Äôs retirement after 41 years at the same company! It took us 2 months to get a reservation but it was WORTH the wait! The food was delicious. perfectly cooked and we had a blast!  We had enough for breakfast today. Thank you!,5,5,5,5,February 6 2024
Great experience. the restaurant is full of cool history from the Rat pack  to Marilyn Monroe dinning there.  Food was great. Steak was cooked to perfection!,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
Amazing service! Delicious food. No complaints. This is a must if you‚Äôre in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
Overall fantastic experience. Old school vibe and service. You couldn‚Äôt get better service anywhere. The food is as described. Solid wine and cocktail list. Definitely worth the visit.,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
Service was excellent. Food was amazing. Definitely going back next trip to Vegas,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
Awesome Place.  Service is like no other.  Classic.  Old School.  Must go!,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
Seconf time we have gone both times great food and great service.,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
The service and food was incredible. We got table side service for our menu and it was worth every penny. The staff at golden steer gave a great history description of the restaurant which added to the already exceptional experience. Highly recommend for all. Reservations is best.,5,5,5,5,February 5 2024
One of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had in Vegas. Lobster and filet were outstanding! Service was top notch!,4,5,5,5,February 4 2024
The most fabulous meal ever! And the ‚ÄúWith Love‚Äù cocktail was the absolute best.,5,5,5,5,February 4 2024
One of the best steakhouse experiences ever! The team there is so kind and charming. Glad I went!,5,5,5,5,February 4 2024
Absolutely outstanding in every respect. Remember to book early as understandably very popular!,5,5,5,5,February 4 2024
Absolutely amazing food! Worth the visit. Steak was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.,5,5,5,5,February 4 2024
It was incredible. Absolutely loved our whole experience. Still talking about it a month later. We‚Äôll be back!,5,5,5,5,February 3 2024
A must go to if you ever in Vegas. The best stake and lobster in town.,5,5,4,5,February 3 2024
I was disappointed. I ordered the surf and turf. My crab legs were dry and my steak was overcooked. The waiter quickly replaced my steak. but the bad impression was already there. I expected my food to be spot on for the price of the meal. It was all right. I wouldn‚Äôt go again.,3,3,5,3,February 3 2024
Under cooked wife‚Äôs steak even though she said they could butterfly it. The excuse was that they need to butterfly thick cuts.,3,3,3,4,February 3 2024
Very good. Classic Vegas. Not a particularly outstanding steakhouse if you're been to other premium steakhouses. Bang for the buck is all there. I dont think it is worth a 2 month lead for reservations.,4,4,4,5,February 3 2024
Amazing service. onion soup was great. short strip was tough and chewy to eat. was very disappointed for the monthly.,3,3,5,5,February 2 2024
The steaks out table ordered arrived at our table and were not cooked as requested.   A porterhouse was delivered rare and the request was medium.  My ribeye arrived medium for 2/3 of the steak and I requested medium rare.  I asked the waiter and he said it was fine and it‚Äôs medium rare.  he said cut over here pointing next to bone which will be rarer than the cap or eye.  I took that as I‚Äôll just eat it.  The porterhouse was taken back and came back close to well done charred.  Very disappointing!  Even the famous Caesars salad was a little wilted.   Didn‚Äôt impress my client especially it took 3 months for this reservation..,3,3,4,5,February 2 2024
Food and service are always fantastic. We we always look forward to coming to the restaurant anytime we are in Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,February 2 2024
Wonderful dining experience from top to bottom. A definite Vegas stop!,5,5,5,5,February 1 2024
A truly wonderful experience for our first time at the golden steer. Justin was AMAZING. and really made the experience something we‚Äôll talk about for a long time. As locals. we don‚Äôt find ourselves vying for an opportunity to visit incredibly famous spots. but we sure are glad we did. The food was immaculate. Hands down the best steak I have ever consumed. We cannot wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,February 1 2024
Outstanding from start to finish. everything was as good as I could expect,5,5,5,5,January 31 2024
"Since 1978 my husband and I  have dined at Golden Steer too often to count. We always invited guests and business associates to enjoy a wonderful  dinner experience. I invited my dear longtime friends to celebrate "" if you will what would have been  my husband  and I  57th wedding anniversary. He would have loved the evening. Thank you for the special dinner.",5,5,5,5,January 31 2024
#1 Top favorite place in Vegas !! Service was amazing everyone so kind and attentive. You cannot go wrong here! Every dish treated with care and the most flavorful dishes you‚Äôll ever have. Thank you !ÔøºÔøº,5,5,5,5,January 30 2024
Always the very best! Our sixth visit and it never disappoints.,5,5,5,5,January 30 2024
Exceeded all expectations. Food was excellent. Will definitely return.,5,5,5,5,January 30 2024
Delicious ribeye. Excellent service. Wait staff was exceptional. Would highly recommend.,5,5,5,5,January 30 2024
Amazing service. outstanding food and unique atmosphere. The whole team of servers worked well together and we never had an empty glass or a long wait. The crab is so tender and juicy and full of flavor. I got the ribeye medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. It seems like everyone is afraid of a little seasoning these days but not Sergio the chef here at the Golden Steer! I commented on the delicious seasoning to the waiter and he said chef Sergio has his own seasoning blend you can buy! We looked at the menu and sure enough they do offer it! We didn‚Äôt end up taking any seasoning blend  home but we really enjoyed it on our meal. Highly recommend!!,5,5,5,5,January 30 2024
If you go to Las Vegas and you don‚Äôt visit Golden Steer. you have not really experienced Las Vegas at all! Amazing food and service and just a perfect throwback to the sexy Vegas of the past!,5,5,5,5,January 29 2024
What a great meal! The Food and service are top notch! The ambiance is fantastic with its classic decor. Everything was what we expected from all the recommendations. We can‚Äôt wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,January 29 2024
Celebrated our birthday with the Golden Steer crew and everything was phenomenal! From the Caesar Salad to the Banana dessert. This is our second time eating here and everything is amazing. Best service in Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,January 29 2024
The food was remarkable. As expected. the steaks were absolutely perfect and so so delicious. but it was the bananas foster that stole the show. Even writing this has me craving MORE! Lovely evening that was only negatively impacted by our exceptionally loud talking waiter. Holy cow - turn down the volume! Regardless. I‚Äôd go again right this minute if I could. Really just a nice evening all around.,4,5,3,5,January 29 2024
The food was fantastic.  as was the service! Best steak ever. and do not miss out on the tableside caesar salads and Cherries jubilee!!,5,5,5,5,January 28 2024
First time here and had an amazing experience. Food was phenomenal and service was excellent. Can't wait to go back.,5,5,5,5,January 28 2024
Wonderful time. great staff. What a must in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,January 28 2024
Like stepping back in time to and old school Vegas,5,5,5,5,January 27 2024
I look forward coming to Golden steer twice a year. Our server did not tell us anything about the menu or about any specials that were going on. He just walked up and said. do you have any questions and would you like to order. We saw other guests getting personalized treatment Ôøºand being explained everything and very interactive. The food quality wasn't the same this time. I love the golden steer. but this time kinda missed Mark.,3,4,2,4,January 27 2024
The best food in town! Beautiful atmosphere! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,January 27 2024
Classic old school steak house.  Prime rib was a C.  Everything else was a B.  Value was below average.,4,4,5,4,January 27 2024
Filet was delicious. Wedge salad also excellent. Top notch place,5,5,5,5,January 27 2024
As advertised.  Food was phenomenal. atmosphere excellent!!,5,5,5,5,January 27 2024
Great ambience but the food quality is overrated for the price.  We had the Longhorn and Lobster Tail for 2 and the best part was the Caesar salad.,3,3,3,4,January 27 2024
We love Golden Steer. would of been 5 stars as usual but the Lobster with the dinner for two was over cooked. the long horn steak was great and the sides were great,4,4,5,5,January 27 2024
The Golden Steer is a must do when we are in Las Vegas. The service. food. and wine list are all great.  Then the history and stories just set this restaurant apart from the others.,5,5,5,5,January 27 2024
Waiting for our table over 20 minutes past our reservation. Had to pester staff to get them to finally seat us.  Meal and table service was excellent though.,3,5,5,4,January 26 2024
Enjoyed the dinner. atmosphere. and food quality.,5,5,5,5,January 26 2024
Brian was the best waiter. Very personable. The food was good. My GF wasn‚Äôt a fan of the spinach but everything else‚Ä¶YUMMY!,5,5,5,5,January 25 2024
The steak was world class. The twice baked potato was dried out.,4,5,5,5,January 25 2024
Excellent dinner. great atmosphere... we always enjoy the Golden Steer...,5,5,5,5,January 25 2024
Prime rib was not so good. Had better at half the price. Service was great.,2,1,5,3,January 25 2024
What an awesome experience. I highly recommend Golden Steer!,5,5,5,5,January 25 2024
Food came out Luke warm  Service was great Drinks weak,4,1,5,4,January 25 2024
We dined tonight for the first time and could not have had a better experience! Not only is the food top notch. the service is beyond impeccable. Our waiter Brian was extremely attentive and never left out glasses low. The table side dessert service led by Jed is a must do! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!,5,5,5,5,January 24 2024
Wonderful food and great service!!! We had a party of 10 and received great care from the servers and prompt attention to our needs. We will come again for sure.,5,5,5,5,January 24 2024
The best steak I‚Äôve ever had!! Got the HUGE lobster tail too and it was awesome!,5,5,5,5,January 24 2024
The staff and food at Golden Steer are incredible. Justin. Tall Eric and Angel did a fantastic job taking care of my group. We loved the great service and the food is amazing. Try the lobster tail. corn. steak and get the cherrie jubilee. Thanks Team,5,5,5,5,January 24 2024
We were seated in a dining room that was not the main dining and did not have the same ambiance.,5,5,5,4,January 24 2024
Absolutely the best steak house in Vegas! Our waiter Justen was excellent and made our first time to Vegas so special.,5,5,5,5,January 24 2024
Food was EXCELLENT. service impeccable. great history. Prime rib was PERFECT! Loved every bite! Caesar salad delicious and enough for 3 to share. Lovely evening. Thank you. will return next time in Vegas,5,5,5,5,January 23 2024
Love this place. It is of the highest quality with old school charm.,5,5,5,5,January 23 2024
First time diner. I was very impressed with the service the steak was outstanding but not as warm as I like. That's my only gripe.,5,5,5,5,January 23 2024
The food was amazing. The service was spectacular and the history is unbelievable.,5,5,5,5,January 23 2024
Old school vegas place.  Little over priced for whats in area.  Lobstwr very good service great,4,3,5,5,January 22 2024
Best dinner in Vegas hands down! Worth the hype!!!,5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
It lived up to the hipe. Truly.  The reception. The table. The ambiance.  The service. Literally. We sat at the table for a minute and they showed up.  The food was perfect.  Shrimp cocktail.  Caesar salad.  Tomahawk and lobster.  Plus piping hot fries and mushrooms.  Then. Omg.  The bananas foster.  It was like 450 with tip and a few drinks. No wine.  But it was our anniversary and why not.,5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
It was all around amazing. I enjoyed a great date night for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday.,5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
"It was a great to experience Las Vegas oldest steakhouse the service and food were on point. Will be back again for sure.""",5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
What an outstanding experience. They knocked it out of the park. One of the best meals ever had.,5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
We live in Vegas and booked our reservations 2 1/2 months in advance. We were seated promptly in the old VIP section and it was so cozy. The service was excellent and the food was just as good. We had the tableside Caesar salad (minimum order of 2 for tableside). calamari. filet mignon. mushroom burgundy. Mac and cheese. tiramisu for dessert. and a couple drinks. The calamari was okay. but everything was excellent!  Cant wait to go back again.,5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
We had a wonderful meal with Tommy as our server. We were a group of seven and we felt like royalty! Thank you Tommy and the Steer for making my husband‚Äôs 30th so special! Everything was excellent. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough!,5,5,5,5,January 22 2024
Great vibe. food. cocktails. service. and ambience. Every aspect of the experience is well thought out and executed. The doorman greeted us on the way in. The hostess with the heart frame glasses graciously welcomed us and directed us to the bar because we arrived early. The bartender with the nice smile saw I was having trouble reading the cocktail menu and quickly provided a large type high contrast option. Besides bringing out food which the kitchen prepared perfectly. the waiter shared some really interesting history about the restaurant.,5,5,5,5,January 21 2024
Great place past its prime. Now only interested in flipping tables. Bored servers whose hearts aren‚Äôt into it. Server couldn‚Äôt get us in and out fast enough and adding tip post tax on meal that expensive is horrible.,3,3,2,4,January 21 2024
It was amazing everything from the service to the food We have been eating about it for years and finally gave it a try - we we not disappointed- the food was perfection,5,5,5,5,January 21 2024
Everything including the service was exceptional.  Worth every penny.,5,5,5,5,January 21 2024
Our best dining experience in Vegas.  Have been to most of the strip major restaurants but none were like this one.,5,5,5,5,January 21 2024
Some of the best food on the planet. Ribeye. filet. Caesar salad. corn. potato‚Ä¶ everything was phenomenal,5,5,5,5,January 20 2024
Over rated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,3,5,2,2,January 20 2024
We had the best dinner. Was worth the wait. Looking forward to the next time.,5,5,5,5,January 20 2024
Food was below average service was good overpriced for what it is,4,2,5,4,January 19 2024
Came to celebrate a special occasion. Service is fantastic. Reminds me of the old Vegas days. Food was great too. Jason the somm was great and really made our evening.,5,4,5,5,January 19 2024
"We made a reservation on 1/18/24 to celebrate our anniversary and indicated as much on the reservation.  The hostess acknowledged our anniversary when we arrived.  She was the LAST person to do so during our entire visit.  Honestly. we felt as though we were a burden to our waiter.  We listened as he interacted with other nearby tables explaining the menu options. asking if they were celebrating anything (which included birthdays and anniversaries). etc.  Our interaction with him was nothing more than ""do you have any questions about the menu?""  My wife even suggested she may be interested in a glass of wine and had ask for a wine list later when it wasn't brought to our table.  Never a single mention of our anniversary was ever made the rest of the night by anyone bringing items to our table.    As we were leaving. I extended my appreciation to the hostess for her acknowledgment.  She apologized for our experience and offered a dessert to go but we declined as we had nowhere to keep it at our hotel.  It is not about the dessert at all.  It is about how we were treated.  I even reached out to management through their website and have yet to receive any response from them.  You can find a great steak pretty much anywhere on the Strip or elsewhere in Vegas.  I would not recommend going to the Golden Steer based on the service.",2,5,1,3,January 19 2024
Hands down amazing! Looked after so well and special thanks to Lorena for finding us a booth and arranging a special desert for my husbands birthday. Hands down the best steak I‚Äôve ever eaten!!!!!!,5,5,5,5,January 19 2024
Food was great and well worth the price. when in Rome. The longhorn and lobster dinner for 2 was plenty enough for the both of us. Table side Caesar salads were unlike any other salad. Bananas foster was fantastic as well!! Highly recommend,5,5,5,5,January 19 2024
Thai place is phenomenal and I‚Äôm glad we got a reservation!,5,5,5,5,January 19 2024
I was so excited to try this restaurant out for my birthday. Waited 3 months for a reservation. We arrived and we're greeted by the front desk. showed to our table and the wait staff served us right away. The drinks came pretty fast. the waiter answered all our questions. But... It started going downhill. Both my friend and I ordered French onion soup. Mine came lukewarm. hers never came and we had to ask two times for it. We both ordered crab legs. mine came very watery and no taste. Hers was okay. The portion was very underrated. My other friend ordered steak and lobster. he said his was great. They also ordered expensive bottles of wine and they loved it. The garlic bread was nothing I've ever tasted before it was awful. I was very disappointed with my experience at the Golden steer.,3,2,4,3,January 19 2024
Excellent dining experience. Highly recommended. From the tableside Cesar salad to the tasty prime rib and side dishes...also tableside Cherries Jubilee.  Everything was great,5,5,4,5,January 19 2024
The Golden Steer Steakhouse has an un paralleled Je ne sais quoi.  You will experience dining the King of England will never enjoy.  Sorry. Charles.,5,5,5,5,January 18 2024
We arrived at 6:20pm for our 6:30pm reservation and was told that there are 6 people ahead of us that also have a 6:30pm reservation and we could sit at the bar.  I thought that was odd that 5 other people had the same reservation so there was no benefit to us being on time .  We ordered the lobster and filet mignon along with the asparagus and roasted potatoes. The food was good. We also ordered French martinis,4,4,5,4,January 18 2024
FANTASTIC SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD!  WE WILL BE BACK.,5,5,5,5,January 18 2024
Wonderful food with impeccable service! Highly recommend. My petite like was cooked perfectly and utterly delicious!,5,5,5,5,January 17 2024
We had an excellent meal! We did not feel rushed at all. It was a little noisy. We were in the 2nd dining room. I think I prefer the first one just after the  bar. Twenty dollar tip to the host did nothing for us as far as a better table.,5,5,5,5,January 17 2024
Please understand I am a big fan of the Golden Steer. How ever. last night was disappointing. I was at a homegrown top in the bar-  Every table around me was being taken care of except mine.  When I finally got the house bread and garlic bread both were almost room temp. not hit as usual.  My steak was great but the twice baked was again not hot and room temp.  I let it go because I thought it would be more agrivating to send them back-but overall for my first time ever at the GS I was not happy.  Jeff Seidel,4,4,3,5,January 17 2024
Food was great. service was excellent. The table-side Caesar Salad is a must have. The Lobster tails are Huge!,5,5,5,5,January 17 2024
Nice atmosphere & very well set up restaurant. Drinks were good. Have to say I was disappointed with the food. Having been looking forward to this booking for the last 4 months I must say it fell below my expectations. Sides were good apart from the fries that hadn‚Äôt been cooked enough & were quite hard. Most of all though my Fillet was definitely not worth the $86. Flavour was good but definitely nowhere near as tender as I‚Äôd hoped it would be. Drinks we ordered were also wrong. Glad we came for the experience but that‚Äôll be it I‚Äôm afraid.,3,3,3,5,January 17 2024
Great food.  The service was excellent. Very much enjoyed our visit.  I already made reservations for May,5,5,5,5,January 17 2024
Overall great experience. Servers and staff were very nice. Some of the food was a bit too salty. I.e.. some bites of the broccoli tasted like there was way too much salt. some bites were perfect. Old fashion was a little watered down. they brought it on the rocks and not with a large cube.  But we loved the environment and love that it is near by our home.,5,5,4,5,January 17 2024
Although the nondescript strip center entrance forebode less. the restaurant is lovely with old school lounge atmosphere. with plush seating. and perfect ambience. Our servers and food were excellent. 5 Stars,5,5,5,5,January 16 2024
It was outstanding‚Ä¶food. ambience and great service! We will be back,5,5,5,5,January 16 2024
First time visit last night.  initially service and staff was great. Towards the end of our meal (which was done) our waiter and staff in general felt like they ignored us for 15 minutes (several empty plates in front of us). A runner did come by and took the small amount of what was left and did box it for us. More time passed before our main waiter came by and offered the dessert menu but by that time the moment had passed. We didn‚Äôt have any management come by our table to see how the service was but luckily as we were walking out we caught one of the managers and let them know the meal was great but again we felt ignored (we were in the main big room in a booth so we were pretty visible). The manager did apologize and said he takes the input seriously. That said I booked another reservation for February (months ago) but after last night I don‚Äôt if we will keep it based on the ending. As any consumer . you want what you pay for and we felt we didn‚Äôt get it.,4,5,3,5,January 16 2024
Amazing food but the atmosphere and service was even better!,5,5,5,5,January 15 2024
Truly unique. Wonderful service and excellent food.,5,5,5,5,January 15 2024
Amazing!! Worth the wait  Worth every penny  The table side ceased salad is amazing,5,5,5,5,January 15 2024
Loved it !!! Food was yummy a old vegas ambiance old school . Food was great service was awesome.,5,5,5,5,January 15 2024
This place has been in Vegas for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to go and finally booked a table which took months to get.  Service and atmospheric were top notch. My steak was cooked perfectly. My biggest complaint was that the food in itself was very salty.  Wish I would have known that in advance and would have asked for it to be seasoned less.,4,3,5,3,January 15 2024
This is my 3rd visit here and it did not disappoint.  I‚Äôve made this my must visit every time I come to Las Vegas.  I think this is possibly my favorite place to eat of all time.  Thanks for always making my visit so fun and pleasant.  I can‚Äôt wait to come back again!,5,5,5,5,January 15 2024
I went 15 years ago for my son‚Äôs birthday and the food and service is still excellent.,5,5,5,5,January 15 2024
Classic Vegas steakhouse. classic Vegas price. Really cool spot to eat. but I do feel like it‚Äôs expensive for the sake of being expensive. I loved it and will be going there again though!,4,4,5,5,January 14 2024
It was well worth the wait. The food was amazing. The service was very helpful and nice. I would recommend to anybody to try at least once.,5,5,5,5,January 14 2024
Absolutely fabulous! Food was outstanding! Service was wonderful and drinks were amazing! Did not disappoint!,5,5,5,5,January 14 2024
Food and service was Top Notch!! Golden Steer never disappoints!!,5,5,5,5,January 14 2024
Great food. exceptional choices. My 2nd visit but unfortunately we were placed in the coat room and not the restaurant. It was a let down as beside the great food is the ambience of this historic place. If you don‚Äôt get to be in the main restaurant it is not the experience you‚Äôre looking for. Spending $1700 on dinner was not worth it based on this loss of experience. The server was pushy and though held the air of being a pro. failed to read the table and offer any value at all. You make a reservation months in advance and they have a take it or leave it attitude on what you are looking for. Hope your time is different but if they want to put people in Siberia at least try and make that room feel like the rest. Best,3,5,3,1,January 14 2024
Whenever I'm in Las Vegas I go to the Golden Steer. Hands down it's always the best meal of my year. My latest visit on 1/13 was no different except that I brought 7 of my closest friends for their first time and all 7 of them proclaimed it as the best steak they gave every had. Was I surprised? No.  For starters. you come here for the food. Everything is perfect every time. Even the dinner rolls they put on the table when you sit down are absolute perfection. You need to start off with an appetizer and you would be selling yourself short if you don't get the Caesar salad prepared table side; however the French Onion soup and the Seafood Stuffed Mushroom Caps are both unreal. My normal steak go to at the Steer is the 24 oz Bone In Ribeye. however our last trip my wife and I decided to split the Longhorn & Lobster Tail Dinner for Two and I'm glad we did. The steak with Maitre'd Butter was sheer perfection and the Australian Lobster Tail was incredible - and we are lobstah snobs from New England. Of course the sides were on point with the mashed potatoes being smooth and creamy while the Mushrooms Burgundy were unlike anything I've ever tasted. Yes we were full but at the end of the night we saved room for the Bananas Foster. also prepared table side.  Now. understand there are hundreds of steakhouses you could go to in Las Vegas. but the Golden Steer is the one you must go to. This is classic old school Las Vegas with the most amazing servers with that classic original steakhouse feeling - think dark wood. no bright lights. and history all over the walls. And yes. there's a great chance you may sit where Frank. Dean. Sammy. Joey & Peter sat.  It's not cheap but who cares? I guarantee it's worth every penny and more. Reserve as soon as you book your trip so you don't miss out.,5,5,5,5,January 14 2024
The service and food was amazing! Worth every penny!,5,5,5,5,January 12 2024
Absolutely loved our experience! The service was impeccable and the food was AMAZING. I had the sea bass and it was prepared perfectly!,5,5,5,5,January 12 2024
La comida fant√°stica. El servicio exelente. Pasamos un momento muy agradable.,5,5,5,5,January 12 2024
Service. cocktails. sides. dessert outstanding.  Steaks were so-so this visit.  The tuxedoed staff was on their game.  They were well coordinated and never disrupted our meal.  The bar and dinner staff were very attentive and helpful and made the experience enjoyable.  We had a couple of steaks at our table that were less than par im my experience.  While the wait staff was proud to say their meat was we prime and wet aged for over 30 days. it didn't taste like it.  My medium-rare ribeye didn't have the juicy consistency I have come to expect and my guest's filet had a funky char that was off putting.  The bananas foster for dessert was indeed amazing both in presentation and more importantly taste.,4,3,5,5,January 12 2024
One of the best filets that I've had in Las Vegas!  Perfectly cooked...I usually have to send mine back at least once...husband's was cooked perfect as well.  Mushrooms were great. lobster amazing and twice baked potato was huge!  They also gave me the booth I wanted.  Will definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,January 12 2024
Food and service are awesome! I would highly recommend this restaurant,5,5,5,5,January 12 2024
The absolute best lobster I‚Äôve had.  The steak was also very good.  My oysters were great.  Specialty drinks were dangerously good.  Those bartenders know how to mix!  Loved it!,5,5,5,5,January 11 2024
Food is always A+++++ love the old school  vibe. Just a little pricy.,5,5,5,5,January 11 2024
This was our first visit to this iconic Las Vegas restaurant. and unfortunately. I think it may be our last. Upon entering. it was very crowded. and no one seemed to know where to go.  We had to wait to speak with the host and notify him of our reservation (which we had to make over 3 months in advance). and still ended up getting seated about 20 minutes late.  We were seated in a booth. which was nice. but very tight and somewhat uncomfortable for 2 of the 3 of us. Our servers were very prompt and wonderful. making sure we got our menus. drinks. and bread quickly.  We placed our order and waited in anticipation.  My sister and I ordered the Longhorn steak and lobster tail for two. which comes with 2 choice sides and soup or salad. We opted for the creamed spinach and Asparagus. one salad with house dressing and one French onion soup. and medium steak.  The salad was way overdressed. the steak more medium well than medium and underseasoned. and the lobster was slightly overdone. However. the sides and soup were delicious.  My brother in law ordered the prime rib medium rare and Whipped potatoes.  His steak was huge. as big as the plate itself. It came with two types of horseradish. but I didn't see any au jus. The potatoes were amazing and had an wonderful texture. Unfortunately. the steak. again. was underwhelming and definitely under seasoned.  There was just no flavor to it. We were asked if we wanted to add any garlic butter to our steaks. and halfway through I wish we had. It jus was disheartening to know that the sides were better than the steaks. especially being a steakhouse.  We finished our meal with the table side cherries jubilee.  The presentation was fun to watch. and the dessert itself was delicious. and definitely enough for us to share.  That was probably our favorite part of the meal.  We had high expectations for this place and were excited to visit the icon. It was just disheartening to be let down. especially because this place isn't cheap.,3,3,5,3,January 11 2024
Everything was delicious and Cooked correctly.would recommend to experience once at least,4,4,4,4,January 11 2024
Th√© food and service were exceptional. A bit pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion,5,5,5,5,January 11 2024
Order the 24oz Ribeye! Stuffed Mushrooms! And a Martini üëå,5,5,5,5,January 11 2024
As someone who dines at steakhouses across the world. we had an incredible experience at the Golden Steer.  We sat in Frank Sinatra's table and ordered the Australian Lobster tail and the thick cut Prime Rib.  Overall a great experience. we will certainly be back!,5,5,5,5,January 10 2024
Great food. great staff & great service. can't get better than that!,5,5,5,5,January 10 2024
Great service Great drinks Great Food Steaks & lobster cooked perfectly,5,5,5,5,January 10 2024
Loved the service and food we will definitely eat there again.,5,4,5,5,January 10 2024
Golden Steer is a Las Vegas staple that has had multiple icons dine there. Their food. service and hard to get reservations speak for themselves. The longhorn cut steak and lobster tail were simply outstanding. The service was impeccable. Each table has 4 waiters to make sure everyone has an excellent experience. Highly recommend the bananas foster. which is made table side. The Caesar salad is also another item made table side and I have never tasted one as good as theirs!,5,5,5,5,January 10 2024
Steak was undercooked and sent back. when they returned the steak it was charred burnt crust and still undercooked. The rest of my party enjoyed their entrees. salmon. chicken. Cesar salad is a must,3,2,4,5,January 9 2024
One of the best places I‚Äôve ever dined at. The preparation of the caesar salad at your table side is great. but better than that was the taste of it. The salad has a bit of a kick to it and definitely stands out from other caesar salads. My wife and I shared the longhorn and lobster with the Mac and cheese and asparagus. The asparagus were good. nothing special but were not under or over cooked. However. the Mac and cheese was superb as the Mac and cheese was very smooth and super creamy. but not strong cheesy like a lot of other restaurants. The meat we ordered medium rare. which came out a little rarer than how we normally get it. but was very juicy and the butter and herbs that they saut√© it with made it very delicious. My favorite main dish was the lobster tail; which was almost the size of the longhorn. The lobster tail was very tender and was not fishy at all. Last but not least we had the cherry jubilee. which was cooked right of the side table once more. The presentation was awesome. but was not a fan favorite of it. Now with all of that came a $289 dollar tab not adding tip. I think it‚Äôs a great spot to try out on special occasions most definitely.,4,5,5,5,January 9 2024
Absolutely loved our dinner. Pricey but in our opinion worth it. Best steaks we‚Äôve ever had. Melted like butter in your mouth. Caesar salad was great! The table side service for the salad and the desserts added that extra touch of excitement. Would have loved some live music to top off the night.,5,5,5,5,January 9 2024
Have been at Golden Steer before with friends from Las Vegas and loved it. The steaks are as they should be. in one word perfect and. which cannot be said about a lot of other restaurants. prices are high end but absolutely worth it. Apart from that is an old style western steakhouse with a lot of history about all sorts of guests that has been there. Hope they will go on in this sam way for many years!,5,5,5,5,January 9 2024
Great meal. great service and we enjoyed our drinks.  E seton‚Äôs was super attentive and our food was amazing !,5,5,5,5,January 9 2024
Golden Steer Steakhouse in Las Vegas is a true gem for steak lovers. From the moment we walked in. the outstanding service set the tone for a remarkable dining experience. Each dish. especially the steaks. was cooked to perfection. offering a blend of rich flavors and succulent textures. The ambiance added to the charm. making our visit not just a meal. but a memorable event. Highly recommended for anyone seeking exceptional food and service in Vegas.,5,5,5,4,January 9 2024
one word!!!!  OUTSTANDING!!!,5,5,5,5,January 8 2024
Delicious and staff was so helpful and attentive. Will return!,5,5,5,5,January 8 2024
Cool place food is not worth the hype dry lobster and steak has a good crust but lacking flavor not a bad steak by any means but not any wow factor,2,2,5,5,January 8 2024
I heard about this place on TikTok and was lucky enough to snag a reservation the week of. I was very impressed by this steakhouse. We sat at Joe DiMaggio's booth. which was quite lovely. The food was incredible! Do no skip on the Caesar salad! The steak was cooked to order. The servers were very attentive to the table  and wonderful. Beverages were always topped off. Enjoyed our first visit and will definitely be back again!,5,5,5,5,January 8 2024
Really nice atmosphere. very attention to detail type of resturant. A place I will visit everytime I come back to Vegas,5,4,5,5,January 8 2024
"After seeing a video Reel of the Golden Steer. we knew we had to go. We wanted a Saturday reservation at 5:30pm which ended up being a 3 month wait. but that was okay. Open table kept in touch with reservation reminders including the menu and dress code. An hour drive from our home. we arrived 30 minutes early and were promptly greeted and seated in a cozy booth. There were many ""walk-ins"" waiting on a table so I was delighted they seated us early. The dining rooms quickly filled up. Service was spot on with multiple suit clad gentlemen prepared to please. Bar drinks were served quickly then appetizer. We opted for the seafood stuffed mushrooms. they were less then satisfying. Tomahawk dinner for 2 plus a lobster tail was a bit of a wait. but the healthy portioned salad kept us busy. Dinner was divine. cooked perfectly. however they forgot to add the chefs herb butter to the Tomahawk. By the time we did receive the butter. the steak was half gone. We were talked into the Cherries Jubilee for dessert. it was delicious! Overall it was a beautiful dinner with wonderful service. We were prepared for what the total bill may be. but it was quite higher. We would love to go back. but unfortunately the incredibly high prices will keep us away. I would recommend. just be prepared to spend A LOT of money.",4,4,5,5,January 7 2024
Table side Cesar salad was too tarte for. ribeye steak was tough. Ambience and wait staff were amazing.,4,3,5,5,January 7 2024
I was very happy to finally get a reservation at this iconic restaurant and to experience it was worth it. That being said. the food & cocktails were good but definitely not the best I‚Äôve had. Order included tableside Caesar (this was the best item). garlic bread. shorthorn medium rare. chicken of the angels. whipped potatoes and asparagus. We were too full for any dessert.,4,3,4,4,January 7 2024
The best experience we‚Äôve had in Vegas! Food portions are insane and way cheaper. The vibe is better than any steak house on the strip.,5,5,5,5,January 6 2024
Best experience ever!!!! Food was amazing as well as the customer service.,5,5,5,5,January 6 2024
Love every aspect of the restaurant service. Perfect meal was perfect.,5,5,5,5,January 6 2024

A must try in Vegas! The food and service was amazing!,5,5,5,5,January 5 2024
A must visit for each time you are Vegas. I just can never make it past the appetizer and salad course - so full!,5,5,5,5,January 5 2024
Incredible food and service!     Lobster is best I‚Äôve ever had. filet as well.   Worth the higher price!,5,5,5,5,January 4 2024
Everyone that was in our party has not stopped thinking about this meal. Not only was this place a great experience. the food was fantastic! From the French onion soup to the table side caesar salad to the lobster and ribeye the size of Texas to the sides to the bananas foster to the coffee liquor drink. god dang delicious!  We had like 10 servers and not once did we feel rushed or that they hovered over us. This is a must do while in Vegas!,5,5,5,5,January 4 2024
Everything from the guy greeting you at the door. to the ambiance and decor. to the food. wait staff. and presentation was perfect. The steaks and sides were great. Tableside Caesar Salad. Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Foster were excellent. Don't change anything. It is a classic.,5,5,5,5,January 4 2024
Absolutely worth the money and the hype.  The dinner for two was filling for both my husband I.  Service was impeccable!,5,5,5,5,January 4 2024
Great atmosphere and polite service. Food always amazing!,5,5,5,5,January 3 2024

Great experience. Great service. ambiance and the food was delectable!,5,5,5,5,January 3 2024
Never knew of this hidden gem. Reservations were easy and accommodating. This is a beautiful restaurant great vibes and the food was bomb. I can‚Äôt wait to go back again service is impeccable. Love it here. You guys know what you‚Äôre doing!!!,5,5,5,5,January 2 2024
This was one of the best dining experiences my now fianc√© and I have ever had. We came to celebrate our 9 year anniversary and had the most magical dinner. The 38 oz. Tomahawk steak was the best steak we have ever eaten in our lives. and to finish the night off with the cherry jubilee dessert was outstanding. My fianc√© proposed after dinner and the waiters we unbelievable in recording it and they offered us complimentary champagne to celebrate. We will be back whenever possible!,5,5,5,5,January 2 2024
This is hands down the best restaurant I‚Äôve ever eaten. The steaks were so tender and delicious.  The lobster was excellent. Everything we ate was phenomenal.  The service was impeccable. This is not a cheap place to eat but it was worth it to us. This is a must do when in Vegas.,5,5,5,5,January 2 2024
Overall the entire experience and service were really good. The banana foster was fantastic and the throwback photos of several old-school celebrities were a joy to see. (Dean Martin. Sammy Davis Jr.. Frank Sinatra. and Joey Bishop).,3,3,5,3,January 2 2024
Best meal we had while in Las Vegas. Lovely place. great service. outstanding food!!! Can‚Äôt wait to return.,5,5,5,5,January 2 2024
Hear great things about this place and just I know why. Food was so awesome very flavorful steaks and baked potatoes where amazing and I have zero complaint about the team of servers . they were all polite and welcoming.  The only complaint is that I made a reservation two months in advance. and gave a pre-pay deposit for a reservation time -  I arrived (10 minutes early) and was politely told ‚Äúyour all checked in we will text you when table is ready. you order cocktails while you wait‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting a 50 minute wait time. The table we were seated was pretty small for 4 guest. all booths that seated 4+ had  only 2 guest dining on them. while others on the tables of 4 were elbow to elbow it felt like.  Everything else was perfect . food was delicious and filling shared memorable dining experience and will be coming back but will be requesting a bigger table next time. and now I‚Äôm prepared of the wait time it was worth the wait.,4,5,4,4,January 1 2024
Went here for NYE. Loved the whole experience!  Staff. food and atmosphere were excellent!  One of the best dining experiences we‚Äôve had!  Will go back! Thank you. Golden Steer!,5,5,5,5,January 1 2024
Great restaurant.  waiters exceptional.  very knowledgeable.  Food was really good except for steak was too salty....very tender.,5,4,5,5,January 1 2024
We had a great meal. but for what we spent. the service wasn‚Äôt great. I got one cocktail and never was asked if I wanted another until talks of desserts started. Had the potential to be a great meal. but for the price I would say it isn‚Äôt worth it.,3,5,2,3,January 1 2024
outstanding . history. culture. class. yes expensive but you get what you pay for and they all deliver...will come everytime a new bucket list ritual,5,5,5,5,December 31 2023
We had the private mobsters toom.  Carlos and James were fantastic waiters.  Great experience!,5,5,5,5,December 31 2023
Heard many wonderful things about this place and decided to try it. I was told this place was a must. We were visiting from Miami and although we could not book at table right away . we were called for an opening for my Husbands BD. Food was amazing. A staple while  visiting Las Vegas.,5,5,5,5,December 31 2023
The server that took our order was dismissive and at times condescending he got our mistral temperatures wrong .    Everyone else was courteous and helpful.   Including the wine steward who em helped us pick the perfect compliment to our steak‚Äôs,4,4,4,5,December 31 2023
First time. did not disappoint. Old school steakhouse that is actually old school.  That's the charm.  Food was awesome Tomahawk steak was the star. Cocktails were tasty. I only rated it a bit noisy as there was a large party in the bar when we arrived. however tableside noise was fine once we got to our booth. Service was stellar! It is not fancy schmancyl is a Steak House and please respect this place and try to dress up. Take some photos! Share and like!,5,5,5,5,December 30 2023
Enjoyed the table side Ceasar salad preparation as well as the bananas foster.  Enjoyed our dinners with everything prepared to order and seasoned well,5,5,5,5,December 30 2023
The best dining experience I‚Äôve ever had. The service. food and ambience were top notch.,5,5,5,5,December 30 2023
The food is good.  but not worth the price.  It could be better for this price tag.  Specifically.  I didn't think the famous lobster tail tasted like anything even with the butter all over it.  Mashed potatoes were flavorless though creamy.  Best thing was the Wedge salad.,4,3,5,5,December 30 2023
they didn‚Äôt let us in because we were wearing pants,1,1,1,1,December 30 2023
Muy buen servicio y la comida excelente . la variedad de bebidas y los platos para todos los gustos,5,5,5,4,December 29 2023
Walking back in time once you walk in - seemed to be well maintained space. Food was good. Glad we went. Wish there was less of a middle ground for dress code - athletic pants aren't allowed. but a hoodie is - doesn't make sense. Either way. glad we went. Attentive staff and lovely evening.,5,5,5,5,December 29 2023
Food was excellent service was superb highly recommended Door man was awesome,5,5,5,5,December 29 2023
Delicious and memorable experience! My husband has been wanting to eat here for years! Must have a reservation to get private room.,5,5,5,5,December 28 2023
We LOVED it!!! We hope to return.   This is one of my favorite Vegas steakhouses,5,5,5,5,December 28 2023
Best steak in the country.  Seriously. the best food and service.,5,5,5,5,December 28 2023
Fantastic dinner! Old school Vegas place with the wonderful vibe.,5,5,5,5,December 28 2023
Booked reservations months in advance to be able to dine at this amazing restaurant. To say we were treated like royalty is an understatement. but the service is exquisite. Food was far superior to anything I've ever had at any other steakhouse and I would recommend the prime rib to anyone who wants their life changed with one bite. Absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish. even going as far as to help an elderly man reserve a taxi after his meal was finished. Just do it. you won't be disappointed.,5,5,5,5,December 28 2023
I've been having a number of meals to celebrate my 60th. All have been excellent but the Golden Steer was the best. As busy as the restaurant was. the meal came in a reasonable time. the service was excellent. and the steak and lobster tail were cooked to perfection. If you can get a reservation (it took me two months). it's worth the wait,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
Amazing food and great staff. A member of staff even took us back to our hotel after we had finished. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better meal and will definitely come back!,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
Staff was exceptional. Dealt with a troubled customer very respectfully. Some people don‚Äôt know how to appreciate what these customer service people do for us I‚Äôm sure they would all much rather be with their families on Christmas Eve than to be dealing with some A-hole. Thank you golden steer staff experience was well worth it. will definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
The Golden Steer delivered sheer bliss! Ambiance. Christmas decor. great bartenders. awesome service and absolutely delicious food. Loved the filet. crab legs. lobster. wedge salad. and double baked potato! Our sommelier Jason even shared some wonderful tidbits of past history at the Steer. A true LV gem!,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
Erich was absolutely fantastic! He made our Caesar salad and bananas foster. He provided the best conversation and answered all of our questions. We would love to come see him again soon!,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
This was one of the best dinning experiences I have ever had. The service is top notch. food is phenomenal. and the history of the location is unmatched. I can‚Äôt wait to go back! ü§©,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
Experience was beyond what I expected. Took my son and gf for Xmas Eve they absolutely loved it and want to go again this Xmas. Service and food left us speechless!!,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
A great big thank you to Ms. Wendy for her hospitality and kindness. and Brian for excellent table service. We shared the wedge salad. the 12 oz Aristocrat Filet Mignon. with a side of grilled asparagus. Everything was done to perfection. Golden Steer Steakhouse is a Las Vegas legend.  We love it.,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
It lived up to the hype. Wife and I were very pleased. Appreciate everyone working that helped us have a memorable night.,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
What you would expect from an Old School Steakhouse. Steak and Lobster was cooked spot on. The staff was attentive to our every need. Would definitely go back again when we are in town.,5,5,5,5,December 25 2023
The best steak I have ever had. Omg. the customer service and the environment was behind amazing.,5,5,5,5,December 24 2023
"This was our 6th or 7th trip for my wife and I to Golden Steer and it was unfortunately the first time we did not leave completely satisfied.  When we arrived I was asked to take my hat off while inside by the guy at the door. We had arrived 30 minutes early (as we do each time) and were told we could wait anywhere in the bar area.  So we sat at a table and a minute later were told we could not sit there because it was reserved as was the table next to it so we ended up finding two spots at the bar.  About 20 minutes and our table was ready - as we walked to the hostess stand I noticed that both ""reserved"" tables were empty.  After ordering and getting our bread and appetizers I went through my glass of soda.  We got our tableside salad which I ate without any soda (hadn't seen our server since ordering).  Finally I'm assuming it was the manager came by and I waved her down asking for a refill on my drink.  We got dinner and I finished my soda about halfway through and never got another refill.  All in all it was a good night but the service SUCKED!  Also as we were eating dinner I noticed at least three other people who were wearing a hat!  I'll be back in June but hopefully we have a different server!",4,5,2,5,December 24 2023
The best place on earth to have a great beef and lobster,5,5,5,5,December 24 2023
A wonderful experience! My birthday dinner was perfect thanks to your amazing hospitality and delicious food!!,5,5,5,5,December 23 2023
Cory is the best! We love our  yearly Christmas dinner at golden steer!,5,5,5,5,December 23 2023
Classic Las Vegas steakhouse. Must dining for tourists and locals.,5,5,5,5,December 23 2023
Table side salad and desert were nice touches. Best Caesar salad anywhere. A team  of waiters took care of us. Fantastic service.,5,5,5,5,December 23 2023
What a great experience it is to dine here! One of the best cuts of beef I've ever had! My spouse had the Surf and Turf and loved it. Service was great and I can't say enough about Justen and Carlos. They were so professional and polite. and friendly too! The history of this place and the old school vibe make it even better. It's the most legendary steakhouse in Vegas hands down and everyone who loves Vegas has to visit this place at least once. We'll definitely be back.,5,5,5,5,December 23 2023
Food was great. service was not great at all. My first time there and server did not explain anything. But yet had explained to other tables. Asked for extra plate to put some sides on never got one. Didn't know anything about the garlic butter for steak until after I had finished eating and overheard another table asking for it...,3,4,1,4,December 23 2023
Old school      Great service and presentation    Table side Caesar salad . table side flamb√©     Great meatballs and steaks and king crab,5,5,5,5,December 22 2023
Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The food was delicious. the staff wonderful and they let you enjoy your meal -- never rushed. Would highly recommend it to everyone,5,5,5,5,December 22 2023

Best steak I‚Äôve ever had! Lovely ambience and great service!,5,5,5,5,December 20 2023
the service was great lobster 95 for a tail over the top side were good steak the start of the show was awful like chewing tasteless shoe leather and for a 240 buck tomahawk steak price was outrageous for a very poor cut of beef will not return ever total bill with tax and tip was 580 us,2,2,5,5,December 20 2023
Could be better: - The steak and sides were nothing special. The steak was also dry - The lobster was just fine  Great: - Service was over the top - Ambiance was some of the best ever,3,3,5,5,December 19 2023
Our steak was tough and our service not overly attentive or friendly from our main server. Wine selection was not good. We had a good time regardless,2,3,2,4,December 19 2023
The food was amazing and the service was absolutely wonderful.,5,5,5,5,December 19 2023

Lovely feel to this place. Loved the salad prep at the table. Disappointed in the calamari overcooked and broccoli under. Overall a nice experience but for the $$$ we did expect more.,3,3,4,5,December 17 2023
We checked in 30 mins earlier than our reservation time and they seated us 20 mins past our reservation time after I made a stink.  Service was slow.  They forgot about our order and nobody checked in on us for 15 mins until I flagged them down to ask about our food.  They went to check and came back 10 mins later with with our food.  People next to us who ordered after us got their food first? Does that make sense?  Food was flavorful and good.  Would I recommend to go? Not sure Would I go back? Not likely,3,4,2,3,December 17 2023
Always good.  The bananas foster is a must!   Will return!,5,5,5,5,December 17 2023
The lobster was over done. the steak was alright. The ambiance was amazing! Service was friendly and solicitous! The food was overpriced for the taste. I will not go back. I would recommend for the experience. not the food!,3,2,4,4,December 17 2023

Reasonably good quality for the price. steak was overly salty. but still very delicious. the rest of the apps/salad were average‚Ä¶service was frankly kinda snarky. Have had much better dining experiences in Vegas and elsewhere. Pretty bummed ü´§,3,3,3,5,December 14 2023

A must do restaurant in Las Vegas‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a restaurant the likes of the NYC 21 club‚Ä¶very few and very rare to have history. service. food quality. any one of them reason enough to dine there‚Ä¶but they have all three.,5,5,5,5,December 13 2023
We had heard great things about this place and we were not disappointed! Best steak ever- only negative thing to say is that being from the U.K it may be some time before we can visit again!!,5,5,5,5,December 13 2023
Amazing!! If you can get in it is worth every penny. Best meal I have had in years. We will be back. The staff was personal. worked together like a dance.,5,5,5,5,December 13 2023

Food and service were excellent as usual! This place is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!,5,5,5,5,December 12 2023
We were a party of 8 and everyone‚Äôs food came out cold. Because the food was cold the lobster was rubbery. A steak ordered meditate came out over cooked. We were highly disappointed with the service as well. Our waiter did not check on us once after our food came out. Once done eating our plates sat on the table for at least 30 minutes.  We would not recommend nor return.,2,1,2,5,December 11 2023
The most amazing steakhouse in all of Las Vegas. We try and dine here every time we are in Vegas. The wait staff and servers are amazing and the food can‚Äôt be beat. The history behind the location is fascinating and make to sure to ask your waiter about the history and stories.,5,5,5,5,December 11 2023
After booking the wrong date for a table of 8 and sitting in the bar having a few drinks. waiting on a limo to pick us up while everyone was having a good laugh at my expense . the host came looking for me and asked if our party of  8 was still here ?  I said yes . he said he had a cancellation and would like to accommodate us.   Hallelujah!  My grace was saved.  Great Host. great experience and we got a little personal history lesson with the host after our meal .  Showed me the mob room!   We  were one of the last groups to leave.  so it was a nice personal touch by the host.  I think he felt sorry for me.  Fabulous place to eat. drink and the staff is so accommodating. 5 star all the way .      I will definitely be back and I‚Äôm sitting at Elvis‚Äôs table with the right date booked  ü§£üòé,5,5,5,5,December 10 2023
Great experience fantastic food. Highly recommend,5,5,5,5,December 10 2023
Our second visit here and it was as amazing as the first  time. We were seated at the same table we sat at during our visit in February. The food is outstanding and the unique old Vegas ambiance gives it special character.,5,5,5,5,December 10 2023
Amazing! Had reservations at 4:00 right when they opened and the line to get in was pretty long but they did a remarkable job on getting everyone served right away! I will definitely be going back every single time we go to Vegas!,5,5,5,5,December 10 2023
This is literally the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. If I were ever put on death row I‚Äôd make sure this was my last meal lol,5,5,5,5,December 10 2023
